# Find Design System Versions Tool

This tool gathers the versions of our design systems currently being used in the CMS-WDS organization on github.cms.gov.

You can run this tool from the root of the repository directory with the following command:

```
yarn scan-versions
```

## Setup

First, you'll need to create a personal access token through GitHub Enterprise. Here are the [instructions for creating a token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) on github.com.

This token can either be stored in a `.env` file or passed to the tool through the command line.

### Save token to .env file

In `.env` in the root of the repository directory, add

```
GHE_ACCESS_TOKEN=token
```

where `token` is your access token.

### Pass token through CLI

Pass it to the command like this

```
yarn scan-versions --token YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
