# CMS Design System [![Build Status](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/workflows/build/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild+branch%3Amaster+)

> The design system is a set of open source design and front-end development resources for creating Section 508 compliant, responsive, and consistent websites. It builds on the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) and extends it to support additional CSS and React components, utility classes, and a grid framework to allow teams to quickly prototype and build accessible, responsive, production-ready websites.

## Packages

You're currently at the root of a monorepo containing multiple NPM packages located in the [`packages` directory](packages/). Unless you're a contributor or a child design system maintainer, you can ignore the `@cmsgov/design-system-docs` and `@cmsgov/design-system-scripts` packages, as they are mostly focused on the design system's developer tooling and documentation. View the `README.md` in each of these for additional details.

## Running locally

This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management. Yarn helps to ensure everyone is using the same package versions. [**Install Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install), if you don't have it yet.

### Getting started

1. `yarn install`
   - This will also run [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) `bootstrap` which allows us to have multiple packages within the same repo (a monorepo). Lerna installs all our dependencies and symlinks any cross-dependencies.
1. `yarn start`

_Note_: When you create a Git commit, any staged scripts will be automatically ran through ESLint and Prettier. If the linter catches an error, your commit will fail. This is a feature, not a bug :)

### Scripts

These scripts can all be run from the root level of the repo:

- `yarn start`
  - Starts local server running the documentation site
  - Regenerates documentation when files change
- `yarn build`
  - Compile/transpile/uglify everything and makes things release-ready.
- `yarn pre-release`
  - Increments package versions. Read our [Release Process guide](/guides/RELEASE-PROCESS.md) for more info.
- `yarn release`
  - Publishes npm packages. Read our [Release Process guide](/guides/RELEASE-PROCESS.md) for more info.
- `yarn test`
  - Runs JS unit tests
  - Runs Prettier for formatting
  - Lints JS using ESLint
  - Lints Sass using stylelint
- `yarn test:e2e`
  - Runs end to end tests
- `yarn update-snapshots`
  - Updates [Jest snapshots](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html)
- `yarn lint`
  - Runs just the linting portion of the tests

### Visual regression testing

In addition to unit and e2e tests, we're using [backstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) for visual regression testing. Here's how to run the tests.

- Install backstopJS `yarn install`
- Run the site locally `yarn start`
- In a new terminal window run the backstop tests `backstop test`
  - This will test the local CMSDS documentation site against the CMSDS production documentation site
- After the tests run an html report will open in your browser showing passed and failed tests
- When introducing a visual change, run `backstop approve` to commit new reference files after confirming the change with `backstop test`

**Note:** Use `backstop reference` to update and replace all reference files.

## Design Assets

The CMS Design System provides a Sketch file and Sketch Library containing components, styles, and symbols. These are regularly updated alongside our code, and updates are automatically synced for designers using the Sketch Library.

[Read more on using Sketch with the CMS Design System](/design-assets/README.md)

## Examples

Examples of the design system in use can be found in the [`examples` directory](examples/).
