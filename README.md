# CMSGov Design System

> A shared set of design and code elements for creating accessible and consistent websites. An extension of the [US Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/)

You're currently at the root of a monorepo which contains multiple projects in the `packages` directory. The root of this project has code related to the development and build process, so it's probably not that useful to you unless you're a contributor.

**This repo includes the following. View the README in each of these for more details.**

### [Core NPM package](packages/core/)

This package directory contains the core CSS and React components for the design system. This is the code most people using the design system will interact with.

### [Documentation site](packages/docs/)

This directory contains code related to the documentation website. Unless you're a contributor, this directory isn't that interesting to you.

### [Yeoman generator](packages/generator-cmsgov/)

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator used in the development process. Again, unless you're a contributor, this directory isn't that interesting to you.

## Examples

Examples of the design system in use can be found in the [`examples` directory](tree/master/examples).

## Contributing

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document to learn about setting up a local development environment, contributing to the design system, and our coding guidelines.
