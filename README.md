# CMS Design System [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CMSgov/design-system.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CMSgov/design-system)

> The design system is a set of open source design and front-end development resources for creating Section 508 compliant, responsive, and consistent websites. It builds on the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) and extends it to support additional CSS and React components, utility classes, and a grid framework to allow teams to quickly prototype and build accessible, responsive, production-ready websites.

## Packages

You're currently at the root of a monorepo which contains multiple NPM packages located in [`packages` directory](packages/). View the `README.md` in each of these for additional details.

**Internal packages**

These packages are project dependencies, mostly focused around the design system's developer tooling and documentation.

| Name                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| [Documentation site](packages/docs/)                         | This directory contains code related to the documentation website. Unless you're a contributor, this directory isn't that interesting to you.                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Examples

Examples of the design system in use can be found in the [`examples` directory](examples/).

## Contributing

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document to learn about contributing to the design system, and our coding guidelines.

## Running locally

This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management. Yarn helps to ensure everyone is using the same package versions. [**Install Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install), if you don't have it yet.

### Getting started

1. `yarn install`
   - This will also run [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) `bootstrap` which allows us to have multiple packages within the same repo (a monorepo). Lerna installs all our dependencies and symlinks any cross-dependencies.
1. `yarn start`

_Note_: When you create a Git commit, any staged scripts will be automatically ran through ESLint and Prettier. If the linter catches an error, your commit will fail. This is a feature, not a bug :)

### Scripts

These scripts can all be run from the root level of the repo:

- `yarn start`
  - Starts local server running the documentation site
  - Regenerates documentation when files change
- `yarn build`
  - Compile/transpile/uglify everything and makes things release-ready.
- `yarn bump`
  - Increments package versions. Read "[Versioning](/guides/RELEASE-PROCESS.md#versioning)" for more info.
- `yarn generate`
  - Generates the necessary files for a new core component
  - Alias: `yarn g`
- `yarn test`
  - Runs JS unit tests
  - Lints JS using ESLint
  - Lints Sass using stylelint
- `yarn test:e2e`
  - Runs end to end tests
- `yarn test:e2e packages/core/Autocomplete`
  - Runs a single end to end test, this example runs Autocomplete
- `yarn test:watch`
  - Runs JS unit tests and will continue to run tests as files change
- `yarn update-snapshots`
  - Updates [Jest snapshots](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html)
- `yarn lint`
  - Runs just the linting portion of the tests

#### Theme scripts

You can also use the following scripts to [build and preview a theme](https://design.cms.gov/startup/site-package/):

- `yarn start:theme`
- `yarn build:theme`

These scripts will also place the documentation into a `docs` subdirectory in your theme's directory.

If you have multiple directories inside of `packages/themes`, you can specify which theme to use by passing the scripts the name of the folder. For example: `yarn start:theme my-theme-folder-name`

If your documentation site will be uploaded to a subdirectory (ie. example.com/design-system), you can set its root path by passing the `--root` option. For example: `yarn build:theme --root design-system`

### Visual regression testing

We're using [backstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) for visual regression testing. Here's how to run the tests.

- Install backstopJS `yarn install`
- Run the site locally `yarn start`
- In a new terminal window run the backstop tests `backstop test`
  - This will test the local CMSDS documentation site against the CMSDS production documentation site
- After the tests run an html report will open in your browser showing passed and failed tests
- When introducing a visual change, run `backstop approve` to commit new reference files after confirming the change with `backstop test`

**Note:** Use `backstop reference` to update and replace all reference files.
