# RFC's

This folder contains RFC (Request for Comment) documents. A template can be found at `./_template.md`.

RFCs are useful when team feedback is required before making architecture or design decisions, or any topic that warrants discussion facilitated with documentation.

## Creating a new RFC

- Create a new branch for your RFC PR
- Copy the `_template.md` file to a new file that is prefixed with YYYY-MM & appropriately titled
- Fill out the template accordingly
- Submit the PR with the `[RFC]` PR title prefix and tag
- Commence discussion, adjusting the RFC based on feedback
- Once all questions defined in the RFC are satisfied, and PR is accepted, merge it. Note: the goal is to have the RFC reviewed by multiple people and perspectives. The RFC PR should not be merged at first approval in order to give others time to provide feedback.

### RFC Status Options

- WIP: The author is still drafting the RFC and it’s not ready for review.
- Review: The Review label is used when the RFC is ready for comments and feedback.
- Approved: When the RFC is for the purpose of making a decision, the Approved label indicates that the decision has been made.
- Implemented: When the RFC is for the purpose of making a decision, the Implemented label indicates that the RFC’s proposal has been implemented.

## Cleaning up old RFCs

Keeping RFC documents around for historical purposes is generally a good idea, but it's inevitable that the documents in this folder will get stale over time.

Consider whether the content in the document should be migrated to a more permanent documentation location, or if it can safely be deleted (we have git history, after all).
