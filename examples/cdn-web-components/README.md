## Example: Using Web components with the CDN

This shows the usage of CMS design system web components from the CDN:

- Include the core CSS bundle and theme
- Include the JS vendor files and design-system bundle
- Use CSS layout, utility, and component classes
- Render web components from our library

## Getting started

1. Run `./copy.sh` (Temporary step until we've deployed to the CDN)
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
