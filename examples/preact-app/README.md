## Example: Using Preact in a React project

This example shows how you can incorporate the design system into a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) application. This differs from [the preact-react-app example](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/main/examples/preact-react-app) in that we're using Preact directly.

## Getting started

1. Install packages at the root of this repository (see [root README](../../README.md))
1. Compile and bundle assets: `yarn run build`
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
