## Example: webpack-demo

This example shows the usage of CMS design system in a simple static site which uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to bundle and manage the asset pipeline.

It includes a basic Webpack config to read and copy assets into a `dist` folder, which you can then deploy. There are various ways to configure Webpack, so feel free to refer to this set up or modify it to suit your needs. The config included here is based on this tutorial: https://www.sitepoint.com/bundle-static-site-webpack/

## Getting started

1. Install packages: `yarn install`
1. Compile and bundle assets: `yarn run build`
1. Open `dist/index.html` in a browser.
