`<Button>`

The `Button` component accepts its text as children (AKA inner HTML), which
means you can also pass in HTML or custom components. This gives you a lot of
flexibility and supports a variety of advanced use cases. The most common use
case would be passing in an SVG icon along with the text.

In addition to the supported props listed, you can also pass in additional
props, which will be passed to the rendered root component. For example,
you could pass in a `target` prop to pass to the rendered anchor element.
