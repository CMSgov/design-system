## Example: Using plain HTML/CSS with the CDN

This shows the usage of CMS design system components on a pure HTML/CSS page with examples of:

- basic article
- simple form with submit button
- using responsive classes
- loading the core CMSDS styles and a theme definition from the CDN

For more information about the setup, see [documentation for using assets from our CDN](https://design.cms.gov/getting-started/for-developers/#option-2-reference-assets-from-the-cdn).
