## Example: A simple React app

This example shows how you can incorporate the design system into your build process. It uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to bundle and optimize JavaScript files, [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile JSX, and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to transpile Sass and copy static assets from the design system.

## Getting started

1. Install packages at the root of this repository (see [root README](../../README.md))
1. Compile and bundle assets: `yarn run build`
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
