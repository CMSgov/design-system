## Introduction

This example shows how you can incorporate the design system into your build process. It uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to bundle and optimize JavaScript files, [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile JSX, and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to transpile Sass and copy static assets from the design system.

## Getting started

_Note_: The instructions below assume you have Yarn installed. You can also use NPM if that's your flavor.

1. Install packages: `yarn install`
1. Transpile and bundle assets: `yarn run build`
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
