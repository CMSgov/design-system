## Example: A create-react-app project with TypeScript

This shows the usage of CMS design system components in a TypeScript [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) project.

In this project, the design system package is installed as an npm dependency. Refer to [install using npm](https://design.cms.gov/getting-started/for-developers/#option-1-install-using-npm) for instructions on how to install the design system as a dependency package.

## Getting started

1. Install packages: `yarn install`
1. Run the application: `yarn start`

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the `typescript` template. The command to create one yourself is:

```
> npx create-react-app <project-name> --template typescript
```
