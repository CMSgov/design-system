## Example: create-react-app-typescript

This shows the usage of CMS design system components in a typescript [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) project.

Refer to [install with NPM](https://design.cms.gov/startup/installation/) for instructions on how to install the design system as a dependency package. The `.env` is for a basic `create-react-app` configuration with the design system. The [index.scss](https://design.cms.gov/startup/sass-and-css/#using-fonts-and-images) includes the design system's styles and paths for the image and font directories.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the `typescript` template. The command to create one yourself is:

```
> npx create-react-app <project-name> --template typescript
```

## Getting started

1. Install packages: `yarn install`
1. Run the application: `yarn start`
