## Example: Pure HTMS/CSS

This shows the usage of CMS design system components with a pure HTML/CSS set up. Simply include the CSS file in the HTML document.

### Usage

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="packages/design-system/dist/css/index.css" />
```

## Getting started

Install and build the core design system to ensure html-css examples can reference the minified CSS.

1. Install packages: `npm install` or `yarn install`
1. Compile and bundle assets: `npm run build` or `yarn run build`
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
