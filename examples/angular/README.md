## Example: An Angular project with TypeScript

This shows the usage of CMS design system components in a TypeScript-enabled [Angular](https://angular.dev/) project.

In this project, the design system package is installed as an npm dependency. Refer to [install using npm](https://design.cms.gov/getting-started/for-developers/#option-1-install-using-npm) for instructions on how to install the design system as a dependency package.

## Getting started

1. Install packages at the root of this repository (see [root README](../../README.md))
1. Start the application: `yarn start`

_Note: Whenever changes have been made to the design system packages, you must **clear the local cache** for this application to receive those changes by deleting the hidden `examples/angular/.angular` directory._

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command      | Action                                      |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `yarn start` | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4200` |
| `yarn build` | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |
