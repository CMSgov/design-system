## Example: create-react-app

This shows the usage of CMS design system components in a [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) project.

Refer to [install with NPM](https://design.cms.gov/startup/installation/) for instructions on how to install the design system as a dependency package. The `.env` is for a basic create-react-app confirguration with the design system. The [`/src/styles/index.scss`](https://design.cms.gov/startup//sass-and-css/) includes the design system's styles and paths for the image and font directories.
