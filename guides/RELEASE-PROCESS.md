# Release process

1. **Create a release commit**

    1. Get the latest from the `master` branch
         ```
        git pull
         ```
    1. Check the status of your working directory to ensure that you don't have any local changes. If you do have local changes [stash or discard](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/numerous_undo_possibilities_in_git/#quickly-save-local-changes) them before going to the next step.
         ```
        git status
         ```
   1. Run the test suite and ensure JS unit tests, JS linting, and Sass linting pass locally.
         ```
         yarn test
         ```
   1. Run the prepublish script from the root of your local git repo. This will bump the version, build the documentation, and transpile + bundle `dist` assets.
      ```
      ./scripts/prepublish.sh
      ```

   1. Add, commit and push to `master` with a new version number, replacing v1.1.0 with your version:
      ```
      git add --all
      ```
      ```
      git commit -m "Release v1.1.0"
      ```
      ```
      git push
      ```
   1. Create a new release on GitHub 
      1. [Draft a new release on GitHub](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/releases/new)
      1. Tag the release using the [SemVer specification release format](#versioning). For example, `v1.1.0`
      1. Title the release using the release number. For example, `1.1.0`
      1. Follow the format below for the release notes, then publish.

      ```
      ## ðŸš¨ Breaking/Behavioral changes
      ## ðŸš€ Added
      ## ðŸ’… Changed
      ## ðŸ›  Fixed
      ## ðŸ“¦ Internal
      ```

      **Note**: View commits since the last release on github by going to the [releases page](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/releases) or run: ```git log `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`..HEAD --oneline```
      
1. **Publish to NPM**

   1. Log into NPM as `cmsgov`: `npm whoami`.
      1. To use an access token, edit your `~/.npmrc` file so the contents are `//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken={token}`

   1. Run the publish to NPM script.
      ```
      ./scripts/publish.sh
      ```
      This will run `npm publish` for each public package in `packages/`.
      **Note**: You should only publish the `master` branch to NPM. The publish script above will check out the `master` branch if it isn't currently the `HEAD`.
      
1. **Update the design.cms.gov documentation website**

   1. [Log in to CBJ](https://cloudbeesjenkins.cms.gov/prod-master/job/wds/job/Design%20System/job/Deploy%20design-system/) to Deploy the CMS Design System documentation website.
   
      **Note**: Your CBJ user will need to be a member of the `wd-user` group or you will be unable to see the linked job above.
   
   1. Select the branch you'd like to deploy. The default is set to `master`.

   Deploying the documentation website is a multi-stage pipeline that executes the deploy in two stages:
      * The first child job builds `design-system`, creates a tarball from the resulting artifacts, then uploads the tarball to S3.
      * The second child job downloads the tarball from S3, expands it onto the node Jenkins is using for the deploy, then copies the files to Netstorage via `scp`.
      
   **Note**: For a manual process: Visit the [Documentation deploy process page](https://confluence.cms.gov/display/HCDSG/Documentation+deploy+proces) in Confluence for these instructions.

# Versioning

The design system follows the [SemVer specification](http://semver.org/).

## Semantic Versioning

### Patch release

Bug fixes and other minor changes: Increment the last number, e.g. `1.0.1`

Examples:

* Backwards compatible Sass/JS bug fixes
* Tiny visual changes to make the UI more consistent

### Minor release

Backwards compatible new functionality, newly deprecated APIs, or substantial new functionality/improvements to private code: Increment the middle number, e.g. `1.1.0`

Examples:

* Addition of a new component
* New classes, global variables, mixins, functions, or deprecated code
* Minor visual changes to existing components

### Major release

Changes which break backwards compatibility: Increment the first number, e.g. `2.0.0`

Example changes:

* Renamed or removed classes, mixins, functions, placeholders, or global variables.
* Major visual changes to existing components
