# How you can contribute

We're excited you're considering contributing to our [Design System](https://design.cms.gov)!

## Discussing styles, components and patterns

You can discuss the existing styles, components and patterns in the Design System, or ones being developed, by commenting on issues in the [backlog](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/projects/3).

Feel free to:

- ask questions about a style, component or pattern
- answer questions from other contributors
- share examples or demos of a component or pattern
- share research relating to a style, component or pattern

## Propose a new component or pattern

Anyone can propose a new component or pattern for the Design System.

To be successful, proposals need to show that the component or pattern being suggested would be [useful and unique](CRITERIA.md).

Follow 3 steps to propose a component or pattern for the Design System.

### 1. Check the Design System backlog

Check if someone else has already suggested your idea or something similar on the [Design System backlog](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/projects/3).

If your idea is on the backlog and marked as proposed, follow the link and comment on the issue. Say you need the component or pattern and share any examples or evidence you have to support the proposal.

If it’s marked to-do and you would like to work on it, read [how to develop a component or pattern](#developing-a-component-or-pattern).

### 2. Create an issue

If your idea is not on the backlog, [create an issue using the template](/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/propose_new_item.md).

At this stage, you just need to present your idea and evidence of the user needs. Please include screenshots or links to versions of the component or pattern in use. **Note:** Avoid spending time working on a specific design or writing code.

### 3. The issue is reviewed

The [Design System team](/guides/GOVERNANCE.md#design-system-team) will review your item proposal and decide if it is useful and unique.
This review helps people avoid spending time and effort on something that’s not needed.

The Design System team will let you know the decision and recommendations, if there are any.

If the working group agrees your proposal is useful and unique, the Design System team will mark it as to-do on the [ backlog](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/projects/3).

At this point, you can either start to develop the component or pattern or leave it for someone else to work on.

## Developing a component or pattern

### 1. Plan your work with the Design System team

A kick-off meeting will be set up to discuss the component or pattern.

During the meeting, we will:

- agree on the scope of the contribution
- plan what design, content, code and guidance needs working on
- agree timings
- discuss any support you might need
- identify a contact for you to work with from the Design System team

If you’re happy to go ahead, the team will assign you to the issue as a contributor.

### 2. Develop your contribution

While you’re working on your contribution, the Design System team will arrange check-ins to catch up on how the work is going and if you need any help.

Find examples of the component or pattern already in use. Examples and research from government services are usually most relevant. Also, look at how other organizations solve the problem too.

Once you have researched the component or pattern and shown it works for users, the [Design System working group](#) will review it.

### 3. Send your contribution for review

All components and patterns must meet the [contribution criteria](CRITERIA.md) before they can be published. The Design System working group will use the criteria to review your contribution.

The working group will vote if it can be published:

- as it is with no recommendations
- as it is with some recommendations to consider when possible
- only after you have addressed certain recommendations

The Design System team will invite you to meet with them and discuss the decision.

During the meeting, you’ll be able to ask questions, hear recommendations and talk through any queries or concerns.

### 4. Get ready to publish

If the working group recommended some changes to make before publishing, the Design System team will help you work on them.

If the working group agrees your contribution meets the criteria, the Design System team will help you get ready to publish. This includes organizing any final checks or updates to the design, content, code and guidance.

After this the pattern or component will be published as Ready.
