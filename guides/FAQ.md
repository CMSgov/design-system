## How is the design system different from the U.S. Web Design System?

The design system is a variation and extension of the [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/). Whenever possible, we use the same markup, styling, and guidance as the U.S. Web Design System and link to related USWDS components from our documentation.

However, the design system differs from the U.S. Web Design System in the following ways:

- **[Code conventions](https://design.cms.gov/guidelines/code-conventions)** - The design system follows a different naming convention in order to avoid conflicts with existing CSS and to deliver clarity and resilience.
- **[Utilities](https://design.cms.gov/utilities)** - The design system includes granular utility classes for forming a variety of UI patterns.
- **React support** - The design system includes React components for the majority of UI components.

Credits to 18F and GSA for the hard work and care put into USWDS. We're excited to contribute back any learnings and progress.
