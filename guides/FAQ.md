## How is the design system different from the U.S. Web Design System?

The design system is based off of v1 of the [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/). Whenever possible, we use the same markup, styling, and guidance as the U.S. Web Design System and link to related USWDS components from our documentation.

However, we have added components, design patterns, and other features unique to the needs of the CMS.gov platform. The CMS Design System differs from the U.S. Web Design System in the following ways:

- **[Code conventions](https://design.cms.gov/guidelines/code-conventions)** - The design system follows a different naming convention in order to avoid conflicts with existing CSS and to deliver clarity and resilience.
- **[Utilities](https://design.cms.gov/utilities)** - The design system includes our own set of utility classes.
- **React support** - The design system includes React components for the majority of UI components.

Credits to 18F and GSA for the hard work and care put into USWDS. We're excited to contribute back any learnings and progress.
