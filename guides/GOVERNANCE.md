# Governance

[Governance](https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/) is a framework for establishing roles, processes, and decision-making authority. It's for making sure the design system can adapt and thrive as time goes on.

## Makers and users

Makers of the design system are those who create and maintain the system. Users of the design system are those who take the system and apply its elements. Bugs and enhancements will often be realized by users, but those changes should be acted on by the makers of the design system.

On the spectrum of design system users and makers, the makers and users of the system are in close proximity and sometimes a user of the system will also be a maker. Communication between the two groups should be frequent to ensure that the system is smart, flexible, scalable, and addresses the needs of the users.

Below is a framework to guide the communication and collaboration between makers and users.

## Roles

As the design system is adopted by more projects, the spectrum of design system users and makers widens, and there is a more distinct separation between makers and users. It's important to establish roles for these different makers and define their responsibilities.

### Steering committee

The steering committee consists of the product owner and program leads. They have final authority over this project and can help find consensus on updates and modifications to the design system.

#### Responsibilities

- Champion the product, product team, and team needs
- Collaborate with core team to deliver on initiatives
- Remove impediments
- Design and technical direction
- Project governance and process

### Core design system team

A core design system team member makes significant and valuable contributions to the design system.

#### Responsibilities

- Design and technical leadership and implementation
- Project governance and processes
- Management and coordination of team members
- Commit and merge pull requests
- Maintain and contribute documentation, guidelines, and best practices
- Participate in the review, validation, and testing
- Introduce new users to the design system

### Contributors

A Contributor is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request. Anyone may propose a new pattern or an amendment to existing patterns.

#### Ways to contribute

- Suggest documentation, guidelines, and best practices
- Submit pull requests
- Submit bugs
- Participate in reviews, validation, and testing
