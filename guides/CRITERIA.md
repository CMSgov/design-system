# Design System criteria

The contents of the Design System are high quality and meet user needs. To guarantee this, all components and patterns must meet certain criteria.

## New proposals

To be successful, proposals need to show that the component or pattern being suggested would be useful and unique.

### Useful
There is evidence that this component or pattern would be useful in many different situations and contexts.
Evidence could be screenshots or links to versions of it being used in different services.

### Unique
It doesn’t duplicate something which already exists in the Design System, unless it’s intended to replace it.

Proposals in the [backlog](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/projects/3)  are reviewed to check if they meet these criteria. Proposals that meet the criteria will then be moved into the 'To do' column, ready to be worked on.


## Before a component or pattern is published

Implementation of the component or pattern is reviewed to make sure it is usable, consistent, and versatile.

### Usable

It has been shown to work with users, including those with disabilities and has passed both accessibility testing and validating.

### Consistent

It follows style and code guidelines in the Design System where possible.
[Coding guidelines](CODING-GUIDELINES.md)

### Versatile

The implementation is versatile enough that the component or pattern can be used in different scenarios. For example, a versatile date input component could be set up to ask for year only, a month and year only, a precise date, or any other combination you may need.
