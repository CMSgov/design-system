## Welcome!

We're excited you're considering contributing to our design system. If you have a question, noticed a bug, or have suggestions, then please submit an issue or create a pull request.

One of our goals is to ensure a welcoming environment for all contributors. Please take a look at our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to learn more.

Below you'll find information on how to setup a local development environment and how to contribute code to the design system.

### Additional information

In **[our Wiki](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/wiki)** you can find additional information like:

* Pattern proposal process
* Coding guidelines
* Guiding principles
* How to write documentation
* etc.

## Running locally

This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management. Yarn helps ensure everyone is using the same package versions. If you've used NPM before, you'll have no trouble using Yarn.

[**Install Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install), if you don't have it yet.

### Getting started

1. `yarn install`
   * This will also run [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) `bootstrap` which allows us to have multiple packages within the same repo (a monorepo). Lerna installs all our dependencies and symlinks any cross-dependencies.
1. `yarn start`

_Note_: When you create a Git commit, any staged scripts will be automatically ran through ESLint and Prettier. If the linter catches an error, your commit will fail. This is a feature, not a bug :)

### Scripts

These scripts can all be run from the root level of the repo:

* `yarn start`
  * Starts local server running the documentation site
  * Regenerates documentation when files change
* `yarn build`
  * Compile/transpile/uglify everything and makes things release-ready.
* `yarn bump`
  * Increments package versions. Read "[Versioning](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/wiki/Versioning)" for more info.
* `yarn generate`
  * Generates the necessary files for a new core component
  * Alias: `yarn g`
* `yarn test`
  * Runs JS unit tests
  * Lints JS using ESLint
  * Lints Sass using stylelint
* `yarn test:watch`
  * Runs JS unit tests and will continue to run tests as files change
* `yarn update-snapshots`
  * Updates [Jest snapshots](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html)
* `yarn lint`
  * Runs just the linting portion of the tests

#### Theme scripts

You can also use the following scripts to [preview and build a theme](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/wiki/site-packages-and-themes):

* `yarn start:theme`
* `yarn build:theme`

These scripts will also place the documentation into a `docs` subdirectory in your theme's directory.

If you have multiple directories inside of `packages/themes`, you can specify which theme to use by passing the scripts the name of the folder. For example: `yarn start:theme my-theme-folder-name`

If your documentation site will be uploaded to a subdirectory (ie. example.com/design-system), you can set its root path by passing the `--root` option. For example: `yarn build:theme --root design-system`

## Submitting a pull request

Here are a few guidelines to follow when submitting a pull request:

* Branch off of `master`: `git checkout -b username/branch-name`
* Commit your changes
* Make a pull request against the `master` branch
