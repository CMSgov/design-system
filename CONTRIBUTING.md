## Welcome!

We're excited you're considering contributing to our design system. If you have a question, noticed a bug, or have suggestions, then please submit an issue or create a pull request.

One of our goals is to ensure a welcoming environment for all contributors. Please take a look at our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to learn more.

Below you'll find information on how to setup a local development environment and how to contribute code to the design system.

### Additional information

In **[our Wiki](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/wiki)** you can find additional information like:

- Pattern proposal process
- Coding guidelines
- Guiding principles
- How to write documentation
- etc.

## Running locally

This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management. Yarn helps ensure everyone is using the same package versions. If you've used NPM before, you'll have no trouble using Yarn.

[**Install Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install), if you don't have it yet.

### Getting started

1. `yarn install`
1. `yarn bootstrap:yarn`
1. `yarn start`

The `bootstrap:yarn` command runs [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) which allows us to have multiple packages within the same repo (a monorepo). Lerna installs all our dependencies and symlinks any cross-dependencies. If you're using `npm` rather than `yarn`, there is also a `bootstrap:npm` command.

### Scripts

These scripts can all be run from the root level of the repo:

- `yarn start`
  - Starts local server running the documentation site
  - Regenerates documentation when files change
- `yarn build`
  - Compile/transpile/uglify everything and makes things release-ready.
- `yarn bump`
  - Increments package versions. Read "[Versioning](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/wiki/Versioning)" for more info.
- `yarn generate`
  - Generates the necessary files for a new core component
  - Alias: `yarn g`
- `yarn test`
  - Runs JS unit tests
  - Lints JS using ESLint
  - Lints Sass using stylelint
- `yarn test:watch`
  - Runs JS unit tests and will continue to run tests as files change
- `yarn lint`
  - Runs just the linting portion of the tests

#### Theme scripts

You can also use the following scripts to [preview and build a theme](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/wiki/site-packages-and-themes):

- `yarn start:theme`
- `yarn build:theme`

If you have multiple directories inside of `packages/themes`, you can specify which theme to use by passing the scripts the name of the folder. For example: `yarn start:theme -- my-theme-folder-name`

## Submitting a pull request

Here are a few guidelines to follow when submitting a pull request:

- Branch off of `staging`: `git checkout -b username/branch-name`
- Commit your changes
- Make a pull request against the `staging` branch

## Merging pull requests

#### Staging

Use the "**Squash and merge**" option when merging pull requests into the `staging` branch. This keeps our history clean and makes it easier on us when it comes time to create a new release.

#### Master

Use the "**Create a merge commit**" option when merging `staging` into `master`. If the pull request includes a version bump, set the commit title to the version number and include the PR # in the commit description.
