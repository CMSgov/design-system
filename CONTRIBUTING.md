## Running locally

### Package management

This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management. Yarn helps ensure everyone is using the same package versions. If you've used NPM before, you'll have no trouble using Yarn.

[**Install Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install), if you don't have it yet.

#### Install build process dependencies

```
yarn install
```

#### Install package dependencies

```
yarn bootstrap:yarn
```

The `bootstrap:yarn` command runs [`yerna`](https://github.com/palantir/yerna) which allows us to have multiple packages within the same repo. Yerna installs all our dependencies and links any cross-dependencies. If you're using `npm` rather than `yarn`, there is also a `bootstrap:npm` command.

_Note_: `yerna` will become obsolete once [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) [is merged into Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/946#issuecomment-264597575).

### Scripts

- `yarn run start` - You'll want to run this when you're developing components. It compiles Sass, transpiles JavaScript, and runs a local documentation instance where you can preview changes.
- `yarn run build` - compile/transpile/uglify everything and makes things release-ready.
- `yarn run bump` - increments package versions. Read "[Versioning](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/wiki/Versioning)" for more info.
- `yarn run generate` - Generates the necessary files for a new core component
- `yarn run g` - Alias for `yarn run generate`
- `yarn test` - tests and lints the codebase.

### Coding guidelines

The CSS coding guidelines for this project try to stay as consistent with [those used by 18F](https://github.com/18F/stylelint-rules). In some cases we've made the decision to be more strict than 18F, using some of [GitHub's stylelint guidelines](https://github.com/primer/stylelint-config-primer). You can [view a full list of stylelint rules here](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules).

JavaScript coding guidelines are enforced using the [default ESLint ruleset](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/conf/eslint.json), along with [Nava's default ruleset](https://github.com/navahq/eslint-config-nava). You can [view a full list of ESLint rules here](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/).

These should be treated as guides â€” rules can be modified according to project needs.
