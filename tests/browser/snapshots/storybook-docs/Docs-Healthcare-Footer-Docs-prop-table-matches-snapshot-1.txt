    "The primary, or root domain where the majority of footer links should be hosted. By default, links render with relative paths, but providing this prop will force all links to render with absolute paths based on the provided string. The string should include the protocol (http:// or https://) and the domain only, with no trailing slash. For example, if the provided string is https://test.healthcare.gov, the topics link will render as https://test.healthcare.gov/topics instead of just /topics. Note that this is only really necessary if your application is hosted on a subdomain, such as https://localhelp.healthcare.gov, where relative links would direct the user to the wrong location, e.g. the link to /topics would incorrectly direct the user to https://localhelp.healthcare.gov/topics when it should direct the user to https://healthcare.gov/topics.\n\nstring",
