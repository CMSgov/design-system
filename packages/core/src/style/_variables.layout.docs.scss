Spacing

The design system uses multiples of `8px` for all spacing values: dimensions, padding, and margins. The goal behind this is to achieve a consistent vertical rhythm and to reduce the cognitive load of fiddling with different spacing options.

## Usage

- Use the [margin](/utilities/margin) and [padding](/utilities/padding) utility classes to change a UI's spacing. These utility classes are named in a way that allows you to use the modifier to calculate the amount of spacing. For example, a margin utility class that adds `16px` of spacing would be `ds-u-margin--2`. We can calculate this by looking at the class's modifier (`2`) and multiplying that by our multiple: `2 × 8px = 16px`
- If you've imported the design system's Sass file, you can also use the spacer Sass variables, which follow the format `$spacer-*` where `*` is a number between 1–7 (i.e. `$spacer-4`)
