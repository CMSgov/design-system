Help Drawer

A help drawer provides a space for medium to long-form help
content â€” content that's too long or not common enough to warrant
being on the page by default.

On large screens it's fixed to the side of the screen, and on
smaller screens it overlays the entire screen.

Render the drawer below the toggle bottom that triggers it.
This way the markup remains semantically sound and screen reader friendly.
