### When to use

- When you need tabular information, such as statistical data.
- When users need to compare sets of information.

### When to consider alternatives

- Depending on the type of content, consider using other presentation formats such as definition lists or hierarchical lists.
- If you're writing out name / value pairs, there's often a more compact way compared to using a table.

### Usage

- Right-align numerical data in tables. You can use a [text alignment utility class](/utilities/text-align) for this. This makes it easier to scan and compare values.

### Accessibility

- Tables can have two levels of headers. Each header cell should have `scope="col"` or `scope="row"`. [Learn more about the "scope" attribute.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#attr-scope)
- Complex tables are tables with more than two levels of headers. Each header should be given a unique `id` and each data cell should have a `headers` attribute with each related header cellâ€™s `id` listed.
- When adding a title to a table, include it in a `<caption>` tag inside of the `<table>` element.
