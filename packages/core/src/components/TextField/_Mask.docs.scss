/*
`<TextField mask={...}>`

A Mask component renders a controlled input field. When the field is blurred, it applies formatting to improve the readability of the value.

Passing a `mask` prop into the `TextField` component with a valid value will
enable formatting to occur when the field is blurred. To "unmask" the
value, you can import and call the `unmaskValue` method.
