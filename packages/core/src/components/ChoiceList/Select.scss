### When to use

- Use sparingly — only when a user needs to choose from about seven to 15 possible options and you have limited space to display the options.

### When to consider alternatives

- If the list of options is short. Use radio or checkboxes buttons instead.
- If the list of options is very long. Let users type the same information into a text input that suggests possible options instead. Long lists can sometimes be broken into multiple shorter lists by asking a few questions up-front to filter out options.
- If you need to allow users to select more than one option at once. Users often don’t understand how to select multiple items from dropdowns. Use checkboxes instead.
- If the data is highly familiar to users, such as the day, month, or year of their birth.

## Guidance

- Choose a sensible order for the options to enable visual scanning of the lists.
- Test dropdowns thoroughly with members of your target audience. Several usability experts suggest they should be the “UI of last resort.” Many users find them confusing and difficult to use.
- Avoid making options in one dropdown menu change based on the input to another. Users often don’t understand how selecting an item in one impacts another.
- When most users will (or should) pick a particular option, make it the default: `<option selected="selected">Default</option>`
- Don’t use JavaScript to automatically submit the form (or do anything else) when an option is selected. Offer a “submit” button at the end of the form instead. Users often change their choices multiple times. Auto-submission is also less accessible.

## Accessibility

- Make sure your dropdown has a label. Don’t replace it with the default menu option (for example, removing the “State” label and just having the dropdown read “Select a state” by default).
- Don’t use JavaScript to automatically submit the form (or do anything else) when an option is selected. Auto-submission disrupts screen readers because they select each option as they read them.
- On some devices the list of options cannot be zoomed, which means that some people with visual impairments cannot use them.
