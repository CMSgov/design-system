Date field

@uswds https://standards.usa.gov/components/form-controls/#date-input

Three text fields are the easiest way for users to enter most dates.

Markup:
<fieldset class="ds-c-fieldset">
  <legend class="ds-c-label">
    <span class="ds-u-font-weight--bold">Date of birth</span>
    <span class="ds-c-field__hint">For example: 4 25 1986</span>
  </legend>
  <div class="ds-l-form-row">
    <div class="ds-l-col--auto">
      <label class="ds-c-label ds-u-margin-top--1" for="month">Month</label>
      <input class="ds-c-field ds-c-field--month" type="number" min="1" max="12" id="month" name="birthdate[month]">
    </div>
    <div class="ds-l-col--auto">
      <label class="ds-c-label ds-u-margin-top--1" for="day">Day</label>
      <input class="ds-c-field ds-c-field--day" type="number" min="1" max="31" id="day" name="birthdate[day]">
    </div>
    <div class="ds-l-col--auto">
      <label class="ds-c-label ds-u-margin-top--1" for="year">Year</label>
      <input class="ds-c-field ds-c-field--year" type="number" min="1900" max="2000" id="year" name="birthdate[year]">
    </div>
  </div>
</fieldset>

## When to use

- Use this format for most dates, particularly memorized dates.

## When to consider alternatives

- If users are trying to schedule something, a calendar picker might make more sense. Be sure to also provide an option for text entry as well.

## Guidance

- Ensure you've [installed both the Core package and Layout package]({{root}}/getting-started)
- Allow users to enter the date as flexibly as possible, for example, allowing `1` as well as `01` for a month input.
- Be sure each field is properly labeled â€” some countries enter dates in day, month, year order.
- It may be tempting to switch all or some of these text fields to drop downs, but these tend to be more difficult to use than text boxes.

## Accessibility

- These text fields should follow the [accessibility guidelines for all text inputs]({{root}}/components/text-field/#guidance).
- Do not use JavaScript to auto advance the focus from one field to the next. This makes it difficult for keyboard-only users to navigate and correct mistakes.
