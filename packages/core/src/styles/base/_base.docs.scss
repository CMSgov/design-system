/*
Base

A base layer of styling can be applied to an area of your site by adding the `ds-base` class. If you're implementing the design system on a new site, you'd likely want to apply this class to the `<body>` element. On existing sites this might not be desirable. In which case, you could apply the `ds-base` class to an element which scopes the styling to itself and its children.

Specifically, the base styling sets the following CSS properties:

- `color` is set to `$color-base`
- `font-family` is set to `$font-sans`
- `font-size` is set to `$base-font-size`
- `line-height` is set to `$base-line-height`

.ds-base--inverse - Applies an inverse `text color` and `background-color`
