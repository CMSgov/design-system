The _HealthCare.gov Design System_ contains shared design and front-end development resources for Healthcare.gov applications, and is built on top of the [CMS Design System](https://design.cms.gov/) (CMSDS). As a _child design system_, it inherits base styles, components, and guidance from the CMS Design System, while also adding its own features and customizations.

## Usage

For documentation on installation and usage, please refer to [our documentation site](https://design.cms.gov/getting-started/developers/installation/?theme=healthcare).

## Contributing

This site-wide design system has a much smaller group of users than the core CMS Design System. It's up to us to make it useful for our apps. It is a place to share code and collaborate across teams. It is our collective source of truth for design. If you want to contribute but need help getting started, shout in the [`#hcgov-design-system` channel](https://cmsgov.slack.com/archives/C0111BVM1LZ) on the CMS Slack or open up an issue on this repo.

## Development

See the [root CMSDS README](../../README.md).
