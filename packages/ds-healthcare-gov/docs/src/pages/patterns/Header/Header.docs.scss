@analytics

The HealthCare.gov header component varies depending on the user's state (ie. logged-in) and context (ie. what page the user is on).

<strong>Note: as part of the header unification effort, the 'inverse' header variation has been removed.</strong>

Google Analytics

**Analytics event tracking is enabled by default.**

On applications where the page has `utag` loaded, the data goes to Tealium which allows it to route to Google Analytics or the currently approved data analytics tools.

### Disabling event tracking

- Import and set the `setHeaderSendsAnalytics` feature flag to `false` in your application's entry file:

```JSX
import { setHeaderSendsAnalytics } from "@cmsgov/<design-system-package>";
setHeaderSendsAnalytics(false);
```
