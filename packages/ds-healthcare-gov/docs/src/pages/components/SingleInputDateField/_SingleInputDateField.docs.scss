### When to use

- A single date input is the preferred component for dates. This can be used with or without the date picker.
- Use for most dates, particularly memorable dates like date of birth, marriage date, health coverage start or end dates, or income start date.

### When to consider alternatives

- Don't use if users are entering a date within the last year or a future date. Instead, use the date picker.

### Usage

Allow users to have flexibility in entering the date, such as allowing one-digit numbers with or without "0" prior to the number, or entering a date with or without slashes to separate month, day, and year.
  - Example: "1" as well as "01" for a month or day.
  - Example: "05/01/2022" as well as "05012022".

### Accessibility

- Users will be able to enter a variety of date formats that automatically format to the correct date format of MM/DD/YYYY. This change happens once the form field loses focus. For example, a user enters a date as "4122020" and it changes to "04/01/2020" once focus leaves the date input.
