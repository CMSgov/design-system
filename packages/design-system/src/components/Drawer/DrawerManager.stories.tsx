      <strong>Space, the final frontier</strong>
      <p>
        In the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the greatest and most
        complex exploration in man&apos;s history. We have felt the ground shake and the air
        shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1 booster rocket, many times as powerful as the Atlas
        which launched John Glenn, generating power equivalent to 10,000 automobiles with their
        accelerators on the floor. We have seen the site where the F-1 rocket engines, each one as
        powerful as all eight engines of the Saturn combined, will be clustered together to make the
        advanced Saturn missile, assembled in a new building to be built at Cape Canaveral as tall
        as a 48 story structure, as wide as a city block, and as long as two lengths of this field.
