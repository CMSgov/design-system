// Classes included in this file are set for deprecation and will be removed in the next major release.

// The `--debugger` variable is used to show what soon-to-be deprecated classes are being used in the browser.
// By default, the value is set to `false`. To enable the debugger, set the variable to `true` in the :root selector.

// This makes it easier to find all the soon-to-be deprecated classes in one place and delete them.

// This adds a border to all soon-to-be deprecated classes.
// When the class is deprecated, remove it from the list below.
