// Classes included in this file are set for deprecation and will be removed in the next major release.

// The `--debugger` variable is used to show what soon-to-be deprecated classes are being used in the browser.
// By default, the value is set to `false`. To enable the debugger, set the variable to `true` in the html selector.
:where(html) {
  --debugger: false;

// Include the soon-to-be deprecated classes here (remove them from their original files).
// This makes it easier to find all the soon-to-be deprecated classes in one place and delete them.
// For each class, include a comment above with the date the class was added to this file. This will help maintainers know how long a class has been listed as deprecated and when it should be removed from the project.

// This adds a border to all soon-to-be deprecated classes.
// When the class is deprecated, remove it from the list below.
@container style(--debugger: true) {
  // .soon-to-be-deprecated-class {
  //   border: 2px solid magenta;
