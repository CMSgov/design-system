## Installation

```
npm install --save @cmsgov/design-system

## Usage

The source files included are written in Sass (`.scss`). You can add your `node_modules` directory to your Sass [`includePaths`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#includepaths) and import the file like this:

```css
@import '@cmsgov/design-system/dist/scss/index';
```

or import the transpiled CSS:

```css
@import '@cmsgov/design-system/dist/css/index';
```

## File Structure

The design system follows a variation of [ITCSS](http://thomasbyttebier.be/blog/less-css-mess) (Inverted Triangle architecture for CSS). The goal is to write CSS in [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) order.
