- Sass mixins and variables
- Responsive flexbox grid framework

## Installation

```
npm install --save @cmsgov/design-system
```

## Usage

The source files included are written in Sass (`.scss`). You can add your `node_modules` directory to your Sass [`includePaths`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#includepaths) and import the file like this:

```css
@import '@cmsgov/design-system/dist/index.scss';
```

or import the transpiled CSS:

```css
@import '@cmsgov/design-system/dist/index.css';
```

[Please view the documentation site for additional information.](https://design.cms.gov/)

Examples of the design system in use can be found in the [`examples` directory](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/master/examples) on GitHub.

## Bugs and contributions

## File Structure

The design system follows a variation of [ITCSS](http://thomasbyttebier.be/blog/less-css-mess) (Inverted Triangle architecture for CSS). The goal is to write CSS in [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) order.
