Additional examples of the CMS Design System (CMSDS) in use can be viewed on the core [CMSDS GitHub](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system). These projects demonstrate the various ways you can incorporate the design system into your development process and various use cases.

## HTML/CSS examples

- [Plain html css page](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/master/examples/html-css)
- [Using webpack](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/master/examples/webpack-demo)

## React application example

[This example](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/master/examples/react-app) shows how you can incorporate the design system into your build process. It uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to bundle and optimize JavaScript files, [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile JSX, and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to transpile Sass and copy static assets from the design system.

## Need help or ran into an issue?
