<h2>Usage</h2>

We offer two versions of design system assets: a minified + compiled version (located in a `dist` directory), and an un-minified + non-compiled version (located in the `src` directory). Use the minified version in production environments. Use the un-minified version in a development environment to debug in the browser, or if you'd like to manage the un-compiled files with your own build system.
