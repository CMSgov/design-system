The design system is a set of open source design and front-end development resources for creating Section 508 compliant, responsive, and consistent websites. It builds on the U.S. Web Design Standards and extends it to support additional CSS and React components, [utility classes]({{root}}/utilities), and a [grid framework]({{root}}/styles/grid/) to allow teams to quickly prototype and build accessible, responsive, production-ready websites.

It is currently being applied to [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/). It is open source and freely available to use by anyone.

## Getting started

- **For developers** - [Download the code as a zip file](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/releases/latest) or [install with NPM](/startup/installation/).
- **For designers** - [Get the Sketch Library](sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCMSgov%2Fdesign-system%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fdesign-assets%2Fcms-design-system-ui-kit.xml) or [downloading the Sketch UI kit](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/raw/master/design-assets/CMS-Design-System-UI-kit.sketch).

## Goals

The primary goals for the design system are to:

- Help create consistent, enjoyable, reliable, and Section 508 compliant websites.
- Promote best practices for usability, accessibility, and responsive web design.
- Empower teams and speed up design and development velocity.
- Serve as a living source of truth for UI standards.

In order to meet these goals we are:

- Using the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov) components and visual design as a foundation.
- Reducing the overall footprint of websites by writing [scalable CSS]({{root}}/guidelines/code-conventions).
- Supporting rapid development with utility classes and easy-to-use components with best practices baked in.
- Reducing the number of decisions needed when iterating on UI by providing a solid foundation of [typography]({{root}}/styles/typography), [layout]({{root}}/styles/grid/), and [color]({{root}}/styles/color).
- Distributing resources as [NPM packages]({{root}}/startup/installation/) which can be easily installed, updated, and imported.
