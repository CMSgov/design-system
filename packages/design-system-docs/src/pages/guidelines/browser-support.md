The {{name}} follows the [2% rule](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/01/25/support-for-browsers/): we officially support any browser above 2% usage and the last 2 browsers versions for each browser as observed by [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/). **Currently, the latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge are supported.**

The CMSDS is designed to be compatible with different operating systems and browser versions in order to provide a broad range of support. [Progressive enhancement and graceful degredation](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement) methodologies are used to accomplish this.
