/*
Changing icon color

Icon components support a few built-in color options that can be applied by using one of the following utility classes.

If you need a different color for an icon, you can pass a custom class to an icon component through the `className` prop. Then, in your application CSS, set the `color` prop.

/*
Changing icon size

Icon components use `ems` for their height and width and can thereby sized by changing the font-size of the SVG element.

It is recommended that the [font-size utilities](https://design.cms.gov/utilities/font-size/) be used.
