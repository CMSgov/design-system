Google Analytics

**Analytics event tracking is disabled by default.**

### Enable event tracking

- Import and set the `setDialogSendsAnalytics` feature flag to `true` in your application's entry file:
```
import { setDialogSendsAnalytics } from "@cmsgov/<design-system-package>";
setDialogSendsAnalytics(true);
```
On applications where the page has `utag` loaded, the data goes to Tealium which allows it to route to Google Analytics or the currently approved data analytics tools.

### Disable event tracking

- Pass the `onComponentDidMount` prop set to `false` to the component:
- Pass the `onComponentWillUnmount` prop set to `false` to the component:

```
analytics={
  {
    onComponentDidMount: {false},
    onComponentWillUnmount: {false}
  }
}
```
### Override  event tracking

- Pass changes via any of the [available analytics props](#components.alert.analytics).
