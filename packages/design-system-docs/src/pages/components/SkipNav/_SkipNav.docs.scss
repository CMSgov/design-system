Skip Nav

Skip navigation links allow users with screen readers to bypass long navigation lists. Make sure you include an `id` at the beginning of your main content and that it matches the skipnav link.

### When to use

- Skip navigation links should come before a long list of navigation links. Most commonly, this occurs before a site's main navigation.

### Usage

- Skip navigation can be visually hidden at first or displayed visually at all times, depending on user needs and design requirements.
- Skip navigation should appear visually on focus.
- The link should skip the user to the main content of the page.
- More than one skip link can be on a page, but be mindful of creating too many.
- Adding a `tabindex="-1"` on the container being skipped to allows older browsers to programmatically move focus properly.
