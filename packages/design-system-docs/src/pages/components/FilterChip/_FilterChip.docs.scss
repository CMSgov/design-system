### When to use

- Use to clearly indicate to the user what filters have been applied to a set of results and provide a quick and easy way to remove a selected filter

### When to consider alternatives

- When many filter chips would be displayed and available screen real estate is limited
- When a badge is sufficient in place of a filter chip

### Usage

- Do not mix badges and filter chip as it can be confusing to the user
- Do not use filter chip when a badge is sufficient, ie when none of the tags are removable
- Filter chips ideally should be short and not wrap to the second line
- Allow adequate spacing (at least 8px) between each filter chip, as much as the design will allow.
- The colors of the Filter Chip can be overriden using the Sass variables listed below, but should not be overriden with colors outside of the color palette.

### Accessibility

- Use `ariaClearLabel` prop so that screenreaders can accurately read out the close icon action
- `Enter`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, and `Spacebar` will remove the tag when it is in focus

### Future research

### Customization

The following Sass variables can be overridden to the filter chip:
- `$filter-chip-icon-container-size` - Height / Width for the close icon container
- `$filter-chip-icon-size` - Height / Width for the close icon in the filter chip
- `$filter-chip-border-radius` - Border radius for the filter chip
- `$filter-chip-text-color` - Text color for the filter chip
- `$filter-chip-background-color` - Background color for the filter chip
- `$filter-chip-border-color` - Border color for the filter chip
- `$filter-chip-text-color-hover` - Text color for the filter chip on hover
- `$filter-chip-background-color-hover` -  Background color for the filter chip on hover
- `$filter-chip-border-color-hover` -  Border color for the filter chip on hover
