### When to use

- To display filter results with one or more tags.

### When to consider alternatives

- When a badge is sufficient in place of a filter chip

### Usage

- Do not mix badges and filter chip as it can be confusing to the user
- Do not use filter chip when a badge is sufficient, ie when none of the tags are removable
- Filter chips ideally should be short and not wrap to the second line

### Accessibility

- Use `removeText` prop so that screenreaders can accurately read out the close icon action
- `Enter`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, and `Spacebar` will remove the tag when it is in focus
- Allow adequate spacing between each filter chip, as much as the design will allow. This helps people with low vision and motor disabilities be able to perceive and interact with the chips.

### Future research

### Customization

The following Sass variables can be overridden to the filter chip:
- `$filter-chip-icon-size` - Height / Width for the close icon in the filter chip
- `$filter-chip-text-color` - Text color for the filter chip
- `$filter-chip-background-color` - Background color for the filter chip
- `$filter-chip-border-color` - Border color for the filter chip
- `$filter-chip-text-color-hover` - Text color for the filter chip on hover
- `$filter-chip-background-color-hover` -  Background color for the filter chip on hover
- `$filter-chip-border-color-hover` -  Border color for the filter chip on hover
