### When to use

Use this date field when:
- User flow requires inputs be separated
- Functionality/back-end systems can't support a single date field entry

Generally used for more memorable dates like date of birth, marriage date, or income start date.

### When to consider alternatives

- Don't use this date field if either [single-input]({{root}}/components/single-input-date-field/) or [date picker]({{root}}/components/date-picker/) are feasible. This pattern is least effective with users.

### Usage

- Allow users to enter one-digit numbers with or without the "0" prior to the number. Example: "1" as well as "01" for a month or day.

### Accessibility

- These text fields should follow the [accessibility guidelines for all text inputs]({{root}}/components/text-field/#guidance).
- Do not use JavaScript to auto advance the focus from one field to the next. This makes it difficult for keyboard-only users to navigate and correct mistakes.
