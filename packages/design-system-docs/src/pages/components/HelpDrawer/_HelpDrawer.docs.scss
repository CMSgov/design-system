Help Drawer

A help drawer provides a space for medium to long-form help
content — content that's too long or not common enough to warrant
being on the page by default.

On large screens it's fixed to the side of the screen, and on
smaller screens it overlays the entire screen.

Render the drawer below the toggle bottom that triggers it.
This way the markup remains semantically sound and screen reader friendly.

### When to use

- When users need help content to remain viewable while also allowing the user to views/interacts with the main page.
- When the help content is longer than 2 sentences.
- When the content needs to be available at a particular point in the process, but doesn't need to be included on the main page.
- When the content just needs to be available at the user's discretion, to provide additional details or context.
- When users may need additional information to complete the task than can be supplied on the main page without overwelming the primary content.

### When to consider alternatives

- When the content is timely/urgent, or critical to the action being taken.
- When the content is intended to clarify or call attention to other content on the page.
- When the content must be displayed without being initiated by a user action.
- When additional information is necessary to the primary information the user is interacting with.

### Usage

- Link text used to trigger the help drawer should be specific and descriptive.
  - Avoid using "Learn more"
  - Limit the amount of link text
- Help drawer content area should include a close button clearly at the top.

### Accessibility

- Focus should move to the content in the help drawer after user has opened it.

### Future research

- Further research or iteration to ensure help drawer links aren't being confused with page load or tooltips links.
