The Medicare.gov Design System is a set of open-source design and front-end development resources for creating usable, accessible (e.g., WCAG/Section 508 compliant), responsive, and consistent Medicare.gov websites.

The Medicare.gov Design System is built on the CMS Design System and extends it to support additional CSS and React components.

## Getting started

### Developers

Developers and engineers are encouraged to use React which allows for more complex, interactive components, and many of our React components have built-in accessibility optimizations.

- **Recommended option:** [Install the NPM package]({{root}}/startup/installation/#install-using-npm) `@cmsgov/ds-medicare-gov` if your project uses npm for package management.

- If you're unfamiliar with npm and package management, [download the code as a zip file]({{root}}/startup/installation/#download-zip).
