<p class="ds-text--lead">Action buttons allow people to take actions from a current state to a future state. They are promises to the user; they must deliver the promise they offer by doing what the button says it would do.</p>

- PRIMARY CTA is TEAL - Use for the priority action that we want users to take. These actions are required for the user to move to the next step in the user flow (example: Enroll).
- SECONDARY CTA is NAVY - Use for actions available but not the primary action we want users to take (example: Plan Details). There doesn't have to be a primary button on the page to use the secondary button.
- TERTIARY CTA is OUTLINE BUTTON with the color that matches the other CTA on the page - Use for actions available but do not take priority over a primary or secondary CTAs (example: Cancel). For example: If primary button is teal, tertiary button has teal outline.
- Outline CTAs are not used alone - They must be paired with either a primary or secondary CTA.  
- Exception: CTA over background hero image on landing pages.
- Lower priority actions are links - Refer to link styling guidelines under Typography.
- Landing Page Button - This larger button is ONLY used in the hero image of landing pages.

<h3>Button classes</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Mobile buttons</b> - Consider using full-width buttons on mobile devices. This will help improve the click range for both left or right-handed users. Use the class <code>mds-c-button--mobile-full-width</code> to apply full-width for mobile and the <a href="/utilities/margin/">responsive margin classes</a> to adjust margins on mobile.</li>
<li><b>Hiding buttons on print</b> - Hide buttons when printing to avoid unnecessary content for printed material. Use the <code>ds-u-visibility--hidden-print</code> class to hide buttons or any other elements on print. Refer to the <a href="/utilities/display-visibility/">display/visibility utilities</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>

`<Button>`

The `Button` component accepts its text as children (AKA inner HTML), which
means you can also pass in HTML or custom components. This gives you a lot of
flexibility and supports a variety of advanced use cases. The most common use
case would be passing in an SVG icon along with the text.

In addition to the supported props listed, you can also pass in additional
props, which will be passed to the rendered root component. For example,
you could pass in a `target` prop to pass to the rendered anchor element.

Design Guidelines

<ul>
<li>Action buttons do NOT include icons. </li>
<li>Exception: Can include icons in buttons in mobile for CTAs outlining functionality. Examples: Filter, Sort, Map, and Menu. </li>
<li>Other exceptions require advance and separate approval than mock-ups by product teams. See "Exception process" in Foundations.</li>
<li>Buttons use title case. Example: Join Plan or Find Doctors.</li>
<li>Note that clickable cards are sentence case. See that component for more information.</li>
</ul>

When pairing 2 CTAs:
<ul>
<li>In forms/decision trees: Have the preferred action be on the right. Example: Back/Next or Cancel/Submit.</li>
<li>All other cases: Have the preferred action be on the left. Example: Create Account/Return to Home or Change My Account/Stop Easy Pay.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Content Guidelines</h2>

<ul>
<li>Describe what will happen, not the current state. <i>Example: Start Over.</i></li>
<li>CTA buttons always start with an action verb that describes the main thing users will be able to do once selected.</li>
<li>Pair it with a noun to help it be more clear. <i>Example: Change Password or Add Drug.</i></li>
<li>If in a form, it can be just the action verb if it's navigating between steps. <i>Example: Cancel, Back, Next, Submit.</i></li>
<li>Use the least amount of words possible (no more than 4).</li>
<li>Use title case for CTA buttons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>

<ul>
<li>Buttons should display a visible focus state when users tab to them.</li>
<li>Create a button with a <code>button</code> or <code>a</code> element to retain the native click functionality. Avoid using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags to create buttons. Screen readers don't automatically know either is a usable button.</li>
<li>When styling links to look like buttons, remember that screen readers handle links slightly differently than they do buttons. Pressing the <code>Space</code> key triggers a button, but pressing the <code>Enter</code> key triggers a link.</li>
<li>Dimmed or unavailable buttons should have the <code>disabled</code> attribute applied. This removes native click and keypress events from the button. It also prevents automated scanners from logging a low contrast error. Finally, it announces the button as "dimmed" or "disabled" to screen readers, offering users additional context.</li>
<li>Disabled buttons - Don’t disable buttons, unless there’s a good reason to.</li>
<li>If you do disable a button, make sure it receives the disabled styling. A button element will automatically be styled as a disabled button when it has the disabled HTML attribute, but an a element will need to have the .ds-c-button--disabled class applied to it.</li>
</ul>
