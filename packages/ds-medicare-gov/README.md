The _Medicare.gov Design System_ contains shared design and front-end development resources for Medicare.gov applications, and is built on top of the [CMS Design System](https://design.cms.gov/) (CMSDS). As a _child design system_, it inherits base styles, components, and guidance from the CMS Design System, while also adding its own features and customizations.

## Usage

`yarn add @cmsgov/ds-medicare-gov`

For full documentation on installation and usage in your Medicare.gov product, please refer to [our documentation site](https://cmsgov.github.io/design-system/medicare/startup/installation/).

## Contributing

This site-wide design system has a much smaller group of users than the core CMS Design System. It's up to us to make it useful for our apps. It is a place to share code and collaborate across teams. It is our collective source of truth for design. If you want to contribute but need help getting started, shout in the [`#mgov-design-system` Slack channel](https://cmsgov.slack.com/archives/C010T7LE5RC) on the CMS Slack or open up an issue on this repo.

## Development

See the [root CMSDS README](../../README.md).

## Building on top of the CMS Design System

As a child design system, the Medicare.gov Design System shares the same tooling and organization as the CMSDS. For more information on how to extend and customize SASS, JS, and documentation, check out the [child design system example and its documentation](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/master/examples/child-design-system).

## Design assets

You can find the Medicare design system Sketch file and related fonts in the [design-assets folder](./design-assets).

You can also view the [Medicare InVision Design System Manager design assets](https://cms.invisionapp.com/dsm/cms/medicare?mode=edit).
