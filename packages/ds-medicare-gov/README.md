The _Medicare.gov Design System_ contains shared design and front-end development resources for Medicare.gov applications, and is built on top of the [CMS Design System](https://design.cms.gov/) (CMSDS). As a _child design system_, it inherits base styles, components, and guidance from the CMS Design System, while also adding its own features and customizations.

## Usage

For full documentation on installation and usage in your Medicare.gov product, please refer to [our documentation site](https://design.cms.gov/getting-started/for-developers/?theme=medicare#getting-the-design-system-assets).

## Contributing

This site-wide design system has a much smaller group of users than the core CMS Design System. It's up to us to make it useful for our apps. It is a place to share code and collaborate across teams. It is our collective source of truth for design. If you want to contribute but need help getting started, shout in the [`#mgov-design-system` Slack channel](https://cmsgov.slack.com/archives/C010T7LE5RC) on the CMS Slack or open up an issue on this repo.

## Development

See the [root CMSDS README](../../README.md).

## Design assets

You can find the Medicare design system Sketch file and related fonts in the [design-assets folder](./design-assets).

You can also view the [Medicare InVision Design System Manager design assets](https://cms.invisionapp.com/dsm/cms/medicare?mode=edit).
