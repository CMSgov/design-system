Hello, I'm Patrick!

00:00:01.971 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm the engineering lead on the design system team

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And today I would like to show you something we've added to our documentation site.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We need to have a chat about maturity.

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.000
...component, maturity, that is.

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:18.999
Some of you may be aware we have had a draft label on some components for ages.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Every once in a while we'd get asked, "What does draft mean?"

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
"Can I use this component?"

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And honestly our team didn't know what it meant either.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It was introduced in an early version of the design system but we never had a clear path for moving out of it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We didn't have a well defined set of criteria for what makes a component fully developed and ready for production.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's been on our to do list for a very long time.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But this program increment we were able to set aside time to tackle this big question.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.601
We established a checklist that helps us measure each component's maturity through well defined and repeatable processes

00:00:54.602 --> 00:01:01.000
and we made a way to display that information on our doc site and that's what I'm going to demo now.

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:07.999
Okay, so here we are on the alert page of our doc site and you'll notice at the bottom we've added a component maturity section.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We've added this to all of our component pages here.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We have it broken down into three categories.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We're working on a fourth for design but we're still auditing the Sketch UI Kit and we want that information to be accurate before we release it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So you'll notice that each of these items can either be complete, incomplete or not applicable. In this case, this is an alert component.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It's not an interactive component,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.586
so keyboard navigation isn't really applicable

00:01:36.587 --> 00:01:47.999
for more information about these items and the testing strategies, whether it was automated or manual testing that we use to mark these as complete or incomplete.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We have a link to that documentation right here, that's more detailed.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So I encourage you to read through all of these, read that documentation.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
If you see a gap, if you see something that's incomplete and you think that your team could fill that gap, please consider contributing.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We love contributions so please reach out. If you don't have time, that's okay.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This is not only a tool for you all to make informed decisions, but it's also a tool for us to be able to see where our gaps are and how we can prioritize our time to make our components more mature.

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.971
Thank you all for watching. If you have questions, please reach out.
