## Examples

<StorybookExample
  componentName="inline-error"
  sourceFilePath="components/InlineError/InlineError.tsx"
  storyId="components-inlineerror--default"
/>

## Code

### React

<SeeStorybookForGuidance storyId={'components-inlineerror--docs'} />

### Web Component

<SeeStorybookForGuidance tech="wc" storyId={'web-components-inlineerror--docs'} />

### Style customization

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize Form components:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="form" />

## Guidance

- Inline errors are built in to all design-system form fields but can be used on their own to create custom fields.
- Inline errors should sit either directly above or below the input, depending on the theme defaults.
- Visually align inline validation messages with the input fields, so people using screen magnifiers can read them quickly.
- The form field should have an `aria-describedby` attribute that references the `id` of the error message.

#### Content

- Describe what the user still needs to do in a mandatory field that has been left incomplete or unanswered, or answered incorrectly.
- Repeat what the form label is asking the user to do, but with slightly more detail.
- Use the fewest words possible (i.e., don't use "please").
- Use sentence case.
- End with a period.

### Accessibility testing

#### General observations

- Inline error text should be outside of the label element.
- Inline error messages should be linked to their corresponding input fields via an `aria-describedby` attribute on the input.
- Inline error text should meet [size and contrast requirements](/foundation/typography/body/#accessibility).

#### Screen reader testing

- When the input field gets focus, its label should be read first and then its hint (if it has one) and its error message.
