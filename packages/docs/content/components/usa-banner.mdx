## Code

### React

<SeeStorybookForGuidance storyId={'components-usabanner--docs'} />

### Web Component

<SeeStorybookForGuidance tech="wc" storyId={'web-components-usabanner--docs'} />

### Style customization

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize UsaBanner components:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="usa-banner" />

<Alert weight="lightweight">

<p className="ds-c-alert__text">
  The USA Banner uses predefined variables from a theme's global tokens to determine the default
  width of its content and gutters (padding).
</p>

For most applications this should be sufficient, but for others with custom layouts it can result in the banner's content appearing misaligned with the content of the rest of a page. To fix this, you can customize the `--usa-banner__max-width` and `--usa-banner-gutter-width` variables to match the application's page width and gutter width.

To illustrate how this works, here's an example of how to customize the banner's width and gutter width for an application with more narrow content:

```css
/* These values can be whatever you need them to be */
:root {
  --usa-banner__max-width: 600px;
  --usa-banner-gutter-width: 1rem;
}
```

## Guidance

### When to use

- To identify as an official government site. Most government sites should use the banner.

### When to consider alternatives

- If you don't use a .gov domain and HTTPS. The banner text identifies .gov domains and HTTPS as indicators that a website is an official government website. Use the banner only if your site uses both the proper TLD and HTTPS.
- Any time it would be misleading. The banner should be used to reduce confusion. Avoid using the banner on any site meant only for testing or otherwise not meant to be identified as an official government website.

### Usage

- Use the provided text without customization. The banner is most effective as an identifier and a learning tool when its message is consistent across government websites.
- Show the banner on every page. Use the banner at the top of every page of a site. It can be confusing or misleading if it appears on some pages and not others.
- Avoid distraction. The banner appears on every page of your site. Choose background colors that fit with your site theme and avoid color combinations that draw excessive attention to the banner.
- Keep the text up-to-date. Use the most current version of the banner.

## Accessibility testing

### Keyboard testing
- Confirm that the banner can be accessed, opened, and closed with only a keyboard.
- When navigating with a keyboard:
  - Use the **Tab** key to move forward and **Shift + Tab** to move backward to reach the banner.
  - Press **Enter** or **Spacebar** to open and close the banner.
- Confirm that focus is clearly visible on each interactive element.
- Confirm that the banner does not trap focus. When you navigate with a keyboard, you can easily move into and out of the banner, regardless of whether the banner is open or closed.
- When you navigate out of an open banner using your keyboard, it doesn‚Äôt automatically close.
- The banner button is the first interactive object after the ‚Äúskip navigation‚Äù link. When you navigate your site with a keyboard and bypass the ‚Äúskip navigation‚Äù link, the "Here‚Äôs how you know‚Äù banner button is the first focusable item on the page.

### Screen reader testing
Use a screen reader (such as **NVDA**, **JAWS**, or **VoiceOver**) to test the banner.
- Screen reader announces button. When you use a screen reader and access the banner, the screen reader uses the word "button" to announce the "Here‚Äôs how you know" button.  
- Screen reader announces collapsed and expanded states. When you first access the "Here‚Äôs how you know" button while using a screen reader, the screen reader announces that it is "collapsed." When activated, the screen reader announces "expanded."  
- Screen reader does not announce decorative icons. When you open the banner with a screen reader, you don‚Äôt hear any information about the flag, blue government building, or green circled lock icon. When you view the `alt` text for the flag, blue government building, and green circled lock icon, you see that the `alt` attribute has an empty value.  
- Screen reader announces the lock icon inside the parentheses. When you open the banner with a screen reader, the screen reader uses the words "lock icon"√• to announce the lock icon inside the parentheses.
