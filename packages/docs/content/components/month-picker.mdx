## Examples

The Month Picker component renders a grid of checkboxes with shortened month names as well as buttons for selecting or deselecting all. For internationalization one can pass a `locale` prop, and the month names will change to match the language of the locale. Full month names are also included as `aria-label` attributes.

<StorybookExample componentName="monthPicker" storyId="components-monthpicker--default" />

### Accessibility

#### Accessibility
- Be mindful of color contrast ratios between the checkbox and its background color. For instance, a dark green or blue behind the component will most likely cause problems for users. When using a dark background, consider using the `inversed` prop. [Read our guidance on color for more information.](../../foundation/system-color-tokens/#accessibility-considerations)

### Accessibility testing

#### Keyboard testing
- All checkboxes can be accessed using only the tab key.
- The checkbox focus follows logical content order. When you tab through the months with a keyboard, the focus stays in order of the content as intended.
- The spacebar is used to check/uncheck a focused checkbox.
- There is a visible focus state.
- The change in state is visible.

#### Screen reader testing

###### For desktop users:
- Some screen readers read the legend text for each element within the fieldset, so it should be brief and descriptive.
- Each label should be announced for every checkbox.
- The checkbox element should be identified with a role of checkbox.
- If hints or errors are present, they are read after the label.
- In a checkbox group, I should hear the question or title related to them via a legend inside a fieldset.
- When the checkbox is selected, that state is read out.

###### For mobile users:
- All the above from the desktop screen reader experience apply.
- Swiping focuses on a checkbox.
- Double tapping with the checkbox in focus makes a selection and announces its been selected.
- Users may select either the text label or the checkbox itself to select an option.
- Click/tap target area is a minimum of 24x24px.
