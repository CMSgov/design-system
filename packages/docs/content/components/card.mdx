## Examples

<StorybookExample componentName="card" storyId="components-card--default" />

## Accessibility

The Card component is primarily a wrapper for other content. As such, while the component itself passes the relevant WCAG 2.0 accessibility tests, teams should take care to test the card implementation thoroughly, including any elements or components that are nested within it.

### Accessibility testing

Card components often contain text, buttons, and icons. The accessibility of those elements should be tested in the context of the Card.
