#### Autocomplete items

An `<Autocomplete>` component accepts a list of items (JavaScript objects) that conform to the shape described by the table below.

| Name                                                  | Type                         | Description                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <code class="ds-u-font-weight--bold">id</code>        | <code>string</code>          | Unique identifier for this item                                                                                            |
| <code class="ds-u-font-weight--bold">name</code>      | <code>string</code>          | Displayed value of the item. May alternatively provide a <code>children</code> value                                       |
| <code class="ds-u-font-weight--bold">children</code>  | <code>React.ReactNode</code> | Custom React node as an alternative to a string-only `name`                                                                |
| <code class="ds-u-font-weight--bold">className</code> | <code>string</code>          | Additional classes to be added to the root element. Useful for adding utility classes.                                     |
| <code class="ds-u-font-weight--bold">isResult</code>  | <code>boolean</code>         | Whether this item should be counted as one of the results for the purpose of announcing the result count to screen readers |

### Style customization

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize Autocomplete components:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="autocomplete" />

#### Text Input Options

The `<Autocomplete>` component also makes use of a text field, which can be customized by the following variables:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="text-input" />

## Guidance

### When to use

- If you are returning results from a known domain like a database of zip codes or a taxonomy of keywords
- If you have a list of options that would cause a [dropdown](/components/dropdown/) to be unusually long

### When to consider alternatives

- When users are choosing from a specific set of options. Consider [checkboxes](/components/checkbox), [radio buttons](/components/radio/), or a [dropdown](/components/dropdown/) in these cases.

### Usage

- Don't use placeholder text in autocomplete fields. Try to write a descriptive label that identifies what the user is searching for. People who have cognitive or visual disabilities have additional problems with placeholder text.
- The length of the text field provides a hint to users as to how much text to write. Do not ask users to write paragraphs of text in this component; use a `textarea` instead.

**[View the "Forms" guidelines for additional guidance and best practices.](/patterns/Forms/forms/)**

### Accessibility

- The `<Autocomplete>` component has taken special care to ensure accessibility for screenreader devices. It announces the number of results based on `items` matches with the `inputValue` string. The component also reads out the name of each list item when users arrow up or down.
- `<Autocomplete>` allows developers to add hint text in the `<label>` element. This hint `<span>` is added to the markup by passing a `String` into the `hint` prop.
- `<Autocomplete>` has a button (styled visually as a link) to clear the search, and refocus the `<input>` element. This resets the local state `selectedItem` to `null`, and will re-read the label and screenreader hint text.
