## Examples

<StorybookExample
  componentName="singleInputDateField"
  storyId="components-singleinputdatefield--with-picker"
/>

## Code

### React

The calendar picker is another name for the `<SingleInputDateField>` with a calendar picker button. To enable the date picker feature, you must pass both a `from<TIME>` property (i.e., `fromDate`, `fromMonth`, etc.) **and** a `to<TIME>` property (i.e., `toDate`, `toMonth`, etc.) to the date field component.

### Style customization

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize Input/Form components:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="text-input" />

#### Form components

This component also makes use of form field styles, which can be customized by the following variables:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="form" />

## Guidance

### When to use

- Use the date picker for dates that have happened within the last year, in the future, or is relevant to selecting the day of the week.

### When to consider alternatives

- Don't use if users are entering a memorable date. Instead, use either [single-](/components/single-input-date-field/) or [multi-input](/components/multi-input-date-field/) date fields.
- Don't use if the date occurred in the distant past (like date of birth).

### Usage

Allow users to have flexibility in entering the date, such as allowing one-digit numbers with or without "0" prior to the number, or entering a date with or without slashes to separate month, day, and year.

- Example: "1" as well as "01" for a month or day.
- Example: "05/18/2022" as well as "05182022".

### Accessibility

- These text fields should follow the [accessibility guidelines for all text inputs](/components/text-field/#guidance).
- Users will be able to enter a variety of date formats that automatically format to the correct date format of MM/DD/YYYY. This change happens once the form field loses focus. For example, a user enters a date as "4122020" and it changes to "04/01/2020" once focus leaves the date input.
- Instructions are available make this more usable/accessible for assistive technology.
