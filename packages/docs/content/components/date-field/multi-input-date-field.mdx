/>

<SeeStorybookForGuidance storyId={'components-multiinputdatefield--docs'} />

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="text-input" />

#### Form components

This component also makes use of form field styles, which can be customized by the following variables:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="form" />

## Guidance

### When to use

Use this date field when:

- User flow requires inputs be separated
- Functionality/back-end systems can't support a single date field entry

Generally used for more memorable dates like date of birth, marriage date, or income start date.

### When to consider alternatives

- Don't use this date field if either [single-input](/components/single-input-date-field/) or [date picker](/components/date-picker/) are feasible. This pattern is least effective with users.

### Usage

- Allow users to enter one-digit numbers with or without the "0" prior to the number. Example: "1" as well as "01" for a month or day.

### Accessibility

- These text fields should follow the [accessibility guidelines for all text inputs](/components/text-field/#guidance).
- Do not use JavaScript to auto advance the focus from one field to the next. This makes it difficult for keyboard-only users to navigate and correct mistakes.

### Related patterns

- [Date field (single-input)](/components/single-input-date-field/)
- [Date field (with calendar)](/components/date-picker/)
