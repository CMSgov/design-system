## `<MultiInputDateField>`

<StorybookExample
  componentName="multiInputDateField"
  storyId="components-multiinputdatefield--multi-input-date-field-default"
/>

### Props

<PropTable componentName="MultiInputDateField" />

## Guidance

### When to use

Use this date field when:
- User flow requires inputs be separated
- Functionality/back-end systems can't support a single date field entry

Generally used for more memorable dates like date of birth, marriage date, or income start date.

### When to consider alternatives

- Don't use this date field if either [single-input](/components/single-input-date-field/) or [date picker](/components/date-picker/) are feasible. This pattern is least effective with users.

### Usage

- Allow users to enter one-digit numbers with or without the "0" prior to the number. Example: "1" as well as "01" for a month or day.

### Accessibility

- These text fields should follow the [accessibility guidelines for all text inputs](/components/text-field/#guidance).
- Do not use JavaScript to auto advance the focus from one field to the next. This makes it difficult for keyboard-only users to navigate and correct mistakes.

## Customization

The following Sass variables can be overridden to customize Input/Form components:

<ComponentThemeOptions
  componentname="text-input"
/>

### Form components

<ComponentThemeOptions
  componentname="form"
/>

- [Date field (with calendar)](/components/date-picker/)
