## Examples

<StorybookExample
  componentName="multiInputDateField"
  storyId="components-multiinputdatefield--default"
/>

## Guidance

### When to use

Use this date field when:

- User flow requires inputs be separated
- Functionality/back-end systems can't support a single date field entry

Generally used for more memorable dates like date of birth, marriage date, or income start date.

### When to consider alternatives

- Don't use this date field if either [single-input](/components/single-input-date-field/) or [date picker](/components/date-picker/) are feasible. This pattern is least effective with users.

### Usage

- Allow users to enter one-digit numbers with or without the "0" prior to the number. Example: "1" as well as "01" for a month or day.

## Accessibility

The multi-input date field component has been tested against, and meets, WCAG 2.0 standards for text size, color contrast, and screen reader usage.

- These text fields should follow the [accessibility guidelines for all text inputs](/components/text-field/#guidance).
- Do not use JavaScript to auto-advance the focus from one field to the next. This makes it difficult for keyboard-only users to navigate and correct mistakes.
- Avoid using placeholder text

### Accessibility testing

#### Screen reader testing

- Screen readers should announce that each individual field is editable
- If the field already has content within it, the screen reader should announce the existing contents.

#### Keyboard testing

- Using only a keyboard, you can navigate to each text field, type in it, and navigate away from it.
- Each field should have a visible focus indicator, and highlight any existing contents, when navigated to

## Code

### React

<SeeStorybookForGuidance storyId={'components-multiinputdatefield--docs'} />

### Style customization

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize Input/Form components:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="text-input" />

### Related patterns

- [Date field (single-input)](/components/date-field/single-input-date-field/)
- [Date field (with calendar)](/components/date-field/date-picker/)
