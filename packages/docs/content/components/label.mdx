/>

## Code

### React

<SeeStorybookForGuidance storyId={'components-label--docs'} />

### Web Component

### Style customization

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize Form components:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="form" />

## Guidance

- Labels/Legends are built into all design-system form fields but can be used on their own to create custom fields.
- Label/Legend text should be short and in sentence case.
- Avoid colons at the end of labels and legends.
- Don't place links or other interactive text in labels or legends. Those should go in the [hint text](/components/hint).
- Don't use a field's placeholder attribute as the primary way to label the field.

### Label

- Each form field should have a clear, brief, and descriptive label.
- Labels should have a `for` attribute, referencing the corresponding input's unique `id` attribute. Only one label can be associated to each unique form element.
- Labels should be placed above their fields.

### Legend

- Use a single legend for fieldset (required). One example of a common use of fieldset and legend is a question with radio button options for answers. The question text and radio buttons are wrapped in a fieldset, with the question itself being inside the legend tag.

### Content

- Use sentence case.
- Content style for labels varies based on the user experience and its goals.
  - Form fields can use traditional labels for many items. (Examples: "First name," "Last name," "Address," etc.) Traditional labels donâ€™t need punctuation.
  - Form labels and decision helpers can use completes sentences (imperatives or questions) for user understanding or conversational feel. (Examples: "Tell us why you need a faster decision." "Select a reason for your request." "Do you want to see costs when you compare X?" "Do you have another mailing address?") Include punctuation.
- For imperative labels, start with an action verb and pair it with a noun to help it be clearer. Example: "Enter your age."
- Use the fewest words possible. Don't use "please" or add unnecessary explanation/context in your label. Instead, use hint text or hint text with a help drawer link to provide information the user must have to correctly enter their answer. 

### Accessibility testing

#### General observations

- Labels should be linked to their corresponding input fields via the `for` attribute. The `for` attribute of the label must exactly match the unique `id` of the related form control.
- No other interactive elements (such as links or buttons) should be included inside the label.
- Label text should meet [size and contrast requirements](/foundation/typography/body/#accessibility).

#### Screen reader testing

- When the label's input field gets focus, the label should be read out.

#### Pointer device testing

- Clicking the label should focus on its input field.
