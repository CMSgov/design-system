## Examples

<StorybookExample
  componentName="formLabel"
  sourceFilePath="components/Label/Label.tsx"
  storyId="components-label--default"
/>

## Code

### React

<SeeStorybookForGuidance storyId={'components-label--docs'} />

### Style customization

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize Form components:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="form" />

## Guidance

- Labels/Legends are built in to all design-system form fields but can be used on their own to create custom fields.
- Label/Legend text should be short and in sentence case.
- Avoid colons at the end of labels and legends.
- Don't place links or other interactive text in labels or legends. Those should go in the [hint text](/components/hint).
- Don't use a field's placeholder attribute as the primary way to label the field.

### Label

- Each form field should have a clear, brief, and descriptive label.
- Labels should have a `for` attribute, referencing the corresponding input's unique `id` attribute. Only one label can be associated to each unique form element.
- Labels should be placed above their fields.

### Legend

- Use a single legend for fieldset (this is required). One example of a common use of fieldset and legend is a question with radio button options for answers. The question text and radio buttons are wrapped in a fieldset, with the question itself being inside the legend tag.

### Content

- Describe what the user needs to do when the field is selected.
- Use a phrase or complete sentence.
- Start with an action verb and pair it with a noun to help it be clearer. Example: `Enter your age.`
- Use the fewest words possible (i.e. don't use "please").
- Use sentence case.

### Accessibility testing

#### General observations

- Labels should be linked to their corresponding input fields via the `for` attribute.
- No other interactive elements (such as links or buttons) should be included inside the label.

#### Screen reader testing

- When the label's input field gets focus, the label should be read out.

#### Pointer device testing

- Clicking the label should focus on its input field.
