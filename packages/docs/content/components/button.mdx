import { ArrowIcon, Button } from '@cmsgov/design-system';

## Examples

The following tables give an overview of the different permutations of buttons available in the selected design system. The controlling traits are the named _variation_, whether it's the _main_ vs. _alternate_ color, and the _on-light_ vs. _on-dark_ context. Each of these traits has its own example later on showing how to apply it.

<ButtonVariationsTable />

### Outline button

<StorybookExample
  componentName="button"
  sourceFilePath="components/Button/Button.tsx"
  storyId="components-button--default&args=children:Outline"
/>

### Solid button

<StorybookExample
  componentName="button"
  sourceFilePath="components/Button/Button.tsx"
  storyId="components-button--default&args=children:Solid;variation:solid"
/>

### Ghost button

<StorybookExample
  componentName="button"
  sourceFilePath="components/Button/Button.tsx"
  storyId="components-button--default&args=children:Ghost;variation:ghost"
/>

### Alternate buttons

Each button variation (outline, solid, ghost) has an alternate option. The alternate options can be styled differently than the main buttons.

#### Outline alternate button

<ThemeContent neverThemes={['healthcare', 'medicare']}>
  <StorybookExample
    componentName="button"
    sourceFilePath="components/Button/Button.tsx"
    storyId="components-button--default&args=children:Outline;isAlternate:true"
  />
</ThemeContent>
<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare', 'medicare']}>
  Outline alternate buttons are not used by this design system.
</ThemeContent>

#### Solid alternate button

<ThemeContent neverThemes={['healthcare']}>
  <StorybookExample
    componentName="button"
    sourceFilePath="components/Button/Button.tsx"
    storyId="components-button--default&args=children:Solid;variation:solid;isAlternate:true"
  />
</ThemeContent>
<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>
  Solid alternate buttons are not used by this design system.
</ThemeContent>

#### Ghost alternate button

<ThemeContent neverThemes={['healthcare', 'medicare']}>
  <StorybookExample
    componentName="button"
    sourceFilePath="components/Button/Button.tsx"
    storyId="components-button--default&args=children:Ghost;variation:ghost;isAlternate:true"
  />
</ThemeContent>
<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare', 'medicare']}>
  Ghost alternate buttons are not used by this design system.
</ThemeContent>

### On dark background

<ThemeContent neverThemes={['healthcare']}>
  <StorybookExample
    componentName="button"
    sourceFilePath="components/Button/Button.tsx"
    storyId="components-button--variations-on-dark"
  />
</ThemeContent>
<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>
  On-dark buttons are not used by this design system.
</ThemeContent>

### Changing the size

Buttons can exist in two alternative sizes: "big" or "small". See the example below.

<EmbeddedExample>
  <div>
    <Button className="ds-u-margin-right--1" size="big">
      Big
    </Button>
    <Button className="ds-u-margin-right--1">Default</Button>
    <Button className="ds-u-margin-right--1" size="small">
      Small
    </Button>
  </div>
</EmbeddedExample>

### Adding icons

- Add an inline SVG icon and it will become the same color as the button text. For the crispest icon rendering, ensure the icon has a square `viewBox` with values that are multiples of `8` (ie. `24x24`).
- Use the margin utility class to add spacing between the icon and button text.

<EmbeddedExample>
  <div>
    <Button className="ds-u-margin-right--1">
      <ArrowIcon direction="left" className="ds-u-margin-right--05" />
      Left Icon
    </Button>
    <Button className="ds-u-margin-right--1">
      Right Icon
      <ArrowIcon direction="right" className="ds-u-margin-left--05" />
    </Button>
    <Button>No Icon</Button>
  </div>
</EmbeddedExample>

## Code

### React

The `Button` component accepts its text as children (AKA inner HTML), which
means you can also pass in HTML or custom components. This gives you a lot of
flexibility and supports a variety of advanced use cases. The most common use
case would be passing in an SVG icon along with the text.

In addition to the supported props listed, you can also pass in additional
props, which will be passed to the rendered root component. For example,
you could pass in a `target` prop to pass to the rendered anchor element.

<PropTable componentName="Button" />

### Styles

The following Sass variables can be overridden to customize Button components:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="button" />

### Google Analytics

**Analytics event tracking is disabled by default.**

#### Enable event tracking

Import and set the `setButtonSendsAnalytics` feature flag to `true` in your application's entry file:

```js
import { setButtonSendsAnalytics } from '@cmsgov/<design-system-package>';
setButtonSendsAnalytics(true);
```

On applications where the page has `utag` loaded, the data goes to Tealium which allows it to route to Google Analytics or the currently approved data analytics tools.

#### Disable event tracking

For the `analytics` prop, pass the value `false` to the component to disable analytics tracking for a singular component instance

```js
analytics={false}
```

#### Override event tracking

A custom heading value can be sent for an analytics event by using the prop `analyticsLabelOverride`. It is recommended that this value be used to prevent sensitive personal information from being passed to analytics trackers.

## Guidance

### When to use

- Use buttons for the most important actions you want users to take on your site, such as "Download," "Sign up," or "Apply."

### When to consider alternatives

- Less popular or less important actions may be visually styled as links.
- Buttons are for performing actions, not making choices. If you need your users to make a choice, use something else like radio buttons. Alternatively, if one choice is much less important then try styling it as a link instead.

### Usage

- Use the "primary" button variation for the button most users should click. This is your primary call-to-action.
- Avoid using too many buttons on a page. Aim to use only one button per page.
- Avoid similar styles elsewhere on the page that could be confused for buttons.
- Use buttons for the primary action and links for secondary actions.

**Label text**

- Use sentence case for button labels.
- Button labels should be as short as possible with “trigger words” that your users will recognize to clearly explain what will happen when the button is clicked (for example, “Save and continue,” “Download” or “Sign up”).
- Make the first word of the button’s label a verb. For example, instead of “Complaint Filing”, label the button “File a complaint.”
- If a button has an icon, it should still have accompanying text describing the action.

**Destructive buttons**

- Use the "danger" button variation for destructive buttons. For example, buttons that delete or reset a user's information.
- Confirm the user meant to trigger a destructive action before following through with the action.
- Provide a method for a user to undo a destructive action.

**Disabled buttons**

- Don’t disable buttons, unless there’s a good reason to.
- If you do disable a button, make sure it receives the disabled styling. A `button` element will automatically be styled as a disabled button when it has the `disabled` HTML attribute, but an `a` element will need to have the `.ds-c-button--disabled` class applied to it.

### Accessibility

- Buttons should display a visible focus state when users tab to them.
- Create a button with a `button` or `a` element to retain the native click functionality. Avoid using `<div>` or `<img>` tags to create buttons. Screen readers don't automatically know either is a usable button.
- When styling links to look like buttons, remember that screen readers handle links slightly differently than they do buttons. Pressing the `Space` key triggers a button, but pressing the `Enter` key triggers a link.
- Dimmed or unavailable buttons should have the `disabled` attribute applied. This removes native click and keypress events from the button. It also prevents automated scanners from logging a low contrast error. Finally, it announces the button as "dimmed" or "disabled" to screen readers, offering users additional context.
