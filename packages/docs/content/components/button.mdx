## Examples

The following tables give an overview of the different available button styles in the selected design system. Each button has three controllable traits that can be used in various combinations. They are:

1. _Variation_: which affects the border and background styles
2. Color: defined as either _main_ or _alternate_
3. Context: specified as either _on-light_ or _on-dark_

See the examples in the following sections to learn how they can be applied.

<ButtonVariationsTable />

### Main buttons

#### Solid button

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

Use solid buttons for the primary actions we want users to take. These actions are required for the user to move to the next step in the user flow (example: Enroll) or to highlight the main/key action.

</ThemeContent>

<StorybookExample
  componentName="solid-button"
  sourceFilePath="components/Button/Button.tsx"
  storyId="components-button--default&args=children:Solid;variation:solid"
/>

#### Outline button

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

Use outline buttons for actions available but not the primary action we want users to take (example: Plan details). There doesn't have to be a primary button on the page to use the secondary button.

</ThemeContent>

<StorybookExample
  componentName="outline-button"
  sourceFilePath="components/Button/Button.tsx"
  storyId="components-button--default&args=children:Outline"
/>

#### Ghost button

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

Use ghost buttons for actions available but do not take priority over a primary or secondary CTAs (example: Cancel).

</ThemeContent>

<StorybookExample
  componentName="ghost-button"
  sourceFilePath="components/Button/Button.tsx"
  storyId="components-button--default&args=children:Ghost;variation:ghost"
/>

### Alternate buttons

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

<Badge variation="alert">
  <CloseIconThin /> Unused by Healthcare.
</Badge>

</ThemeContent>

Each button variation (outline, solid, ghost) has an alternate option. Alternate buttons can be styled differently than the main buttons.

<ThemeContent neverThemes={['healthcare']}>

#### Alternate solid button

  <StorybookExample
    componentName="solid-alt-button"
    sourceFilePath="components/Button/Button.tsx"
    storyId="components-button--default&args=children:Solid;variation:solid;isAlternate:true"
  />
</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent neverThemes={['healthcare']}>

#### Alternate outline button

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

<Badge variation="alert">
  <CloseIconThin /> Unused by Medicare.
</Badge>

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent neverThemes={['healthcare', 'medicare']}>

  <StorybookExample
    componentName="outline-alt-button"
    sourceFilePath="components/Button/Button.tsx"
    storyId="components-button--default&args=children:Outline;isAlternate:true"
  />
</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent neverThemes={['healthcare']}>

#### Alternate ghost button

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

<Badge variation="alert">
  <CloseIconThin /> Unused by Medicare.
</Badge>

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent neverThemes={['healthcare','medicare']}>

  <StorybookExample
    componentName="ghost-alt-button"
    sourceFilePath="components/Button/Button.tsx"
    storyId="components-button--default&args=children:Ghost;variation:ghost;isAlternate:true"
  />
</ThemeContent>

### On dark background

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

<Badge variation="alert">
  <CloseIconThin /> Unused by Healthcare.
</Badge>

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent neverThemes={['healthcare']}>

  <StorybookExample
    componentName="on-dark-buttons"
    sourceFilePath="components/Button/Button.tsx"
    storyId="components-button--variations-on-dark"
  />
</ThemeContent>

### Button sizes

Buttons can exist in two sizes other than default: "big" or "small".

#### Big button

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

<Badge variation="alert">
  <CloseIconThin /> Unused by Healthcare.
</Badge>

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['core', 'medicare']}>

<EmbeddedExample>
  <div>
    <Button size="big">Big</Button>
  </div>
</EmbeddedExample>

</ThemeContent>

#### Small button

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

Small outline buttons are used for utility buttons on a page with other primary and secondary actions (example: Edit, Remove, Add another [something]).

</ThemeContent>

<EmbeddedExample>
  <div>
    <Button size="small">Small</Button>
  </div>
</EmbeddedExample>

### Adding icons

- Add an inline SVG icon and it will become the same color as the button text. For the crispest icon rendering, ensure the icon has a square `viewBox` with values that are multiples of `8` (ie. `24x24`).
- Use the margin utility class to add spacing between the icon and button text.

<EmbeddedExample>
  <div>
    <Button className="ds-u-margin-right--1">
      <ArrowIcon direction="left" className="ds-u-margin-right--05" />
      Left Icon
    </Button>
    <Button className="ds-u-margin-right--1">
      Right Icon
      <ArrowIcon direction="right" className="ds-u-margin-left--05" />
    </Button>
  </div>
</EmbeddedExample>

## Code

### React

The `Button` component accepts its text as children (AKA inner HTML), which
means you can also pass in HTML or custom components. This gives you a lot of
flexibility and supports a variety of advanced use cases. The most common use
case would be passing in an SVG icon along with the text.

In addition to the supported props listed, you can also pass in additional
props, which will be passed to the rendered root component. For example,
you could pass in a `target` prop to pass to the rendered anchor element.

### Experimental Web Components

<SeeStorybookForGuidance tech="wc" storyId={'web-components-button--docs'} />

### Style customization

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize Button components:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="button" />

### Analytics

This component has analytics tracking available. Please see our developer documentation about [using analytics in the design system](/getting-started/for-developers/#analytics).

## Guidance

Buttons are promises to the user; they must deliver the promise they offer by doing what the button says it will do.

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

- Action buttons do NOT include icons.
  <br /> <i>Exception:</i> Can include icons in buttons in mobile for CTAs outlining functionality.
  <br /> Examples: Filter, Sort, Map, and Menu.{' '}
- Other exceptions require advance and separate approval than mock-ups by product teams. See [Exception process](../../guidelines/exceptions/?theme=medicare)" in Foundations.
- Buttons use title case. Example: Join Plan or Find Doctors.
- Note that clickable cards are sentence case. See that component for more information.

When pairing 2 CTAs:

- In forms/decision trees: Have the preferred action be on the right. Example: Back/Next or Cancel/Submit.
- All other cases: Have the preferred action be on the left. Example: Create Account/Return to Home or Change My Account/Stop Easy Pay.

</ThemeContent>

### When to use

- Use buttons for the most important actions you want users to take on your site, such as "Download," "Sign up," or "Apply."

### When to consider alternatives

- Less popular or less important actions may be visually styled as links.
- Buttons are for performing actions, not making choices. If you need your users to make a choice, use something else like radio buttons. Alternatively, if one choice is much less important then try styling it as a link instead.

### Usage

- Avoid using too many buttons on a page. Aim to use only one button per page.
- Avoid similar styles elsewhere on the page that could be confused for buttons.
- Use buttons for the primary action and links for secondary actions.

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

#### Don't

- Use buttons for navigational elements like going to a new page.

</ThemeContent>

**Label text**

- Use sentence case for button labels.
- Button labels should be as short as possible with “trigger words” that your users will recognize to clearly explain what will happen when the button is clicked (for example, “Save and continue,” “Download” or “Sign up”).
- Make the first word of the button’s label a verb. For example, instead of “Complaint Filing”, label the button “File a complaint.”
- If a button has an icon, it should still have accompanying text describing the action.

**Destructive buttons**

- Confirm the user meant to trigger a destructive action before following through with the action.
- Provide a method for a user to undo a destructive action.

**Avoid using disabled buttons**

Disabling a "button" to act as a guide to the level of form completion is a common anti-pattern (e.g., you aren't able to proceed in the next step until the form contains enough data). Why it's a problem:

- Buttons tend to have call-to-action text that matches what users want to do, so people try to interact with them.
- They have terrible color contrast.
- They don’t provide feedback and tell the user why they're disabled. They communicate that something is off, but very often that is not enough information. As a result, users are left wondering what’s actually missing, and consequently are locked out entirely.
- Assistive technologies like [screen readers](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/touchscreen-screen-readers/) and [switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_access) are usually not even able to navigate to disabled buttons.

For these reasons, disabled buttons can be frustrating for all users but especially those with cognitive disabilities and those who use assistive technologies.

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

### Design guidelines

- Buttons are used for actions; links are used for navigation
- Buttons do NOT include icons.
  - Exception: Can include icons in buttons for utility actions like print and save and branded buttons like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube used in the Footer
- When pairing 2 buttons the preferred/main action is placed on the left.
- Ghost buttons are typically used when paired with a Solid or Outline button or to indicate lower priority actions.

</ThemeContent>

### Accessibility

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

Consider when to use links vs. when to use buttons. Links and buttons are read differently using a screen readers. For screen readers buttons can be triggered by pressing the space bar or the enter key while links are only triggered by the enter key. This makes a difference to a screen reader user's flow.

</ThemeContent>

- Buttons should display a visible focus state when users tab to them.
- Create a button with a `<button>` or `<a>` element to retain the native click functionality. Avoid using `<div>` or `<img>` tags to create buttons. Screen readers don't automatically know either is a usable button.
- When styling links to look like buttons, remember that screen readers handle links slightly differently than they do buttons. Pressing the `Space` key triggers a button, but pressing the `Enter` key triggers a link.
- Dimmed or unavailable buttons using the `<a>` tag must have the `aria-disabled` attribute set to true and its `href` attribute removed.
  - Unlike the `<button>`, `disabled` is not a valid attribute for `<a>`. To describe the disabled state to screen reader users, use the `aria-disabled` attribute instead.
  - The `href` attribute is not required on `<a>`, and when it's absent it doesn't create a hyperlink.
- Dimmed or unavailable buttons using the `<button>` tag should have the `disabled` attribute applied. This removes native click and keypress events from the button. It also prevents automated scanners from logging a low contrast error. Finally, it announces the button as "dimmed" or "disabled" to screen readers, offering users additional context.

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

#### Do's

- Use buttons for clickable actions like "Log in" or "Create an account"
- Use buttons for javascript triggers that have a clickable element tied to javascript functionality.
- Use links for navigational elements. `<a>` tags are reserved for navigation.

#### Don't

- Use buttons for navigational elements like going to a new page.

</ThemeContent>

### Content

- Describe what will happen, not the current state.
- Buttons always start with an action word describing the main thing users will do once selected.
  - Pair it with a noun to help it be clearer. Example: Get tips.
  - If in a form, it can be just the action word if it's navigating between steps. Example: Cancel, Back, Next.
- Use the least amount of words possible (no more than 6 with 2-4 being ideal).

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

- Use sentence case for buttons. This conveys a friendlier tone. Note: Some tools and the homepage are using ALL CAPS. There are also a few examples of Title Case. We should change to sentence case for consistency across the site.

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

- Use title case for CTA buttons.

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare', 'medicare']}>

#### Writing content

- Remove articles and use '&' instead of 'and'
- Do not capitalize articles.
- Avoid all caps unless the word is an acronym, like ZIP.
- Avoid pronouns unless the future state provides the user with customized information. Example: "Get my results"
- Limit branded terms, like tool names. As a general rule, we don't use tool names in web content or flow. Rather, content should outline what the user will get/can do when they click the button.

#### Online forms & steps

##### Starting a process or sequential steps

Generally better to use specific verbs to confirm what the user is starting. For example, "Create Account."
