Components are designed, self-contained UI elements, implemented with a combination of HTML, CSS, and javascript. While you can apply our CSS to your own HTML elements and add your own JavaScript, **we strongly recommend using the JavaScript versions of our components.** The JavaScript components generate all the HTML and apply CSS automatically and give you all the best-practice dynamic behaviors for free. We've made these JavaScript components available as React, Preact, and [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). Read more about our different JavaScript component offerings in the following sections.

## React / Preact components

If you are using React or Preact for your application, we have a full library of components available to start using right away. For all other frameworks, try our web components instead. General design, accessibility, and content documentation can be found on that component's doc page, along with links to Storybook where you'll find code-specific documentation. [Read more about using our React/Preact components here](/getting-started/for-developers/#using-reactpreact-components).

## Web components

While not currently a complete representation of our component library, we're now offering web-component versions of many of our components. Check out a component's documentation page to find out whether we offer a web-component version of it.
