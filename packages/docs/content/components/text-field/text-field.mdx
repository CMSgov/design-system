## Guidance

### When to use

- If you can’t reasonably predict a user’s answer to a prompt and there might be wide variability in users’ answers.
- When using another type of input will make answering more difficult. For example, birthdays and other known dates are easier to type in than they are to select from a calendar picker.
- When users want to paste in a response.

### Guidelines

- Don't use placeholder text in form fields. Use hint text instead, if you need to provide contextual information. Placeholder text disappears after a user types a value, therefore users will no longer have that text available when they need to review their entries. People who have cognitive or visual disabilities have additional problems with placeholder text.
- The length of the text field provides a hint to users as to how much text to write. Do not require users to write paragraphs of text into a single-line input box; use a `<textarea>` instead.
- Text fields are among the easiest type of input for desktop users but are more difficult for mobile users.
- Only show error messages or styling after a user has interacted with a particular field.
- When using text fields in a form, ensure there's sufficient spacing between fields. Your fields shouldn't feel cramped and users shouldn't confuse which labels and hint text belong to which fields.
  - 8px, --spacer-1, is recommended between form elements including text fields
  - [Please reference “spacing” guidelines for additional information.](/foundation/spacing/)
- **[View the "Forms" guidelines for additional guidance and best practices.](/patterns/Forms/forms/)**

### When to consider alternatives

- When users are choosing from a specific set of options. Consider [checkboxes](/components/checkbox), [radio buttons](/components/radio/), or a [dropdown](/components/dropdown/) in these cases.

## Accessibility

### Accessibility guidance

- Group each set of thematically related controls in a `fieldset` element. Use the `legend` element to offer a label within each `fieldset`. The `fieldset` and `legend` elements make it easier for screen reader users to navigate the form.
- Keep your form blocks in a vertical pattern. This approach is ideal, from an accessibility standpoint, because of limited vision that makes it hard to scan from left to right.

## Code

### React

A `TextField` component renders an input field as well as supporting UI elements like a label, error message, and hint text.

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize Input/Form components:
