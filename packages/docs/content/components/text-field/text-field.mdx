## Code

### React

A `TextField` component renders an input field as well as supporting UI elements like a label, error message, and hint text.

<SeeStorybookForReactGuidance storyId={'components-text-field--docs'} />

### Styles

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize Input/Form components:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="text-input" />

#### Form components

This component also makes use of form field styles, which can be customized by the following variables:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="form" />

## Guidance

### When to use

- If you can’t reasonably predict a user’s answer to a prompt and there might be wide variability in users’ answers.
- When using another type of input will make answering more difficult. For example, birthdays and other known dates are easier to type in than they are to select from a calendar picker.
- When users want to paste in a response.

### When to consider alternatives

- When users are choosing from a specific set of options. Consider [checkboxes](/components/checkbox), [radio buttons](/components/radio/), or a [dropdown](/components/dropdown/) in these cases.

### Usage

- Don't use placeholder text in form fields. Use hint text instead, if you need to provide contextual information. Placeholder text disappears after a user types a value, therefore users will no longer have that text available when they need to review their entries. People who have cognitive or visual disabilities have additional problems with placeholder text.
- The length of the text field provides a hint to users as to how much text to write. Do not require users to write paragraphs of text into a single-line `input` box; use a `textarea` instead.
- Text fields are among the easiest type of input for desktop users but are more difficult for mobile users.
- Only show error messages or styling after a user has interacted with a particular field.

### Accessibility

- Group each set of thematically related controls in a `fieldset` element. Use the `legend` element to offer a label within each `fieldset`. The `fieldset` and `legend` elements make it easier for screen reader users to navigate the form.
- Keep your form blocks in a vertical pattern. This approach is ideal, from an accessibility standpoint, because of limited vision that makes it hard to scan from left to right.
