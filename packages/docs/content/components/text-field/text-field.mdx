## Examples

### Single line field

<StorybookExample
  componentName="single text field"
  storyId="components-textfield--single-line-field"
/>

### Multiline field

<StorybookExample
  componentName="multi text field"
  storyId="components-textfield--multiline-field"
/>

## Guidance

### When to use

- If you can’t reasonably predict a user’s answer to a prompt and there might be wide variability in users’ answers.
- When using another type of input will make answering more difficult. For example, birthdays and other known dates are easier to type in than they are to select from a calendar picker.
- When users want to paste in a response.

### Guidelines

- Don't use placeholder text in form fields. Use hint text instead, if you need to provide contextual information. Placeholder text disappears after a user types a value, therefore users will no longer have that text available when they need to review their entries. People who have cognitive or visual disabilities have additional problems with placeholder text.
- The length of the text field provides a hint to users as to how much text to write. Do not require users to write paragraphs of text into a single-line input box; use a `<textarea>` instead.
- Text fields are among the easiest type of input for desktop users but are more difficult for mobile users.
- Only show error messages or styling after a user has interacted with a particular field.
- When using text fields in a form, ensure there's sufficient spacing between fields. Your fields shouldn't feel cramped and users shouldn't confuse which labels and hint text belong to which fields.
  - 8px, --spacer-1, is recommended between form elements including text fields
  - [Please reference “spacing” guidelines for additional information.](/foundation/spacing/)
- **[View the "Forms" guidelines for additional guidance and best practices.](/patterns/Forms/forms/)**

### When to consider alternatives

- When users are choosing from a specific set of options. Consider [checkboxes](/components/checkbox), [radio buttons](/components/radio/), or a [dropdown](/components/dropdown/) in these cases.

## Accessibility
- Avoid placeholder text. Most browsers’ default rendering of placeholder text does not provide a high enough contrast ratio. Instead, utilize the required `label` prop to provide a meaningful description of the text field. Optionally, you can use the `hint` prop to provide additional contextual information or clearer directions for use. Using the `label` and `hint` props provides a number of benefits to users, such as lowering the cognitive burden and increasing the interaction area when using the text field.
- When working with numeric input, we provide the `mask` and `inputMode` props. Using the appropriate `mask` prop will correctly format user input, thus avoiding the need to break numbers with distinct sections (such as phone numbers, Social Security Numbers, or credit card numbers) into separate text fields.

## Accessibility testing

For mobile devices, text fields should work in both portrait and landscape orientation with no loss of functionality.

### Keyboard navigation

- Users must be able to use only a keyboard to navigate to the text field, type in it, and navigate away from it.
- Focus indicators must be clearly visible around the text fields.

### Screen reader

- Screen readers must announce text fields and their labels in the same order they appear visually on the page.
- Screen readers must announce the purpose of each text field (e.g., “Edit, blank. Type in text.”).
- Screen readers must announce associated labels and instructions when a text field receives focus (e.g., “Enter first name.”).
- Screen readers must announce any text provided to the `ariaLabel` prop.

### Zoom magnification

- When zoomed to 200%, text fields must remain legible, functional, and properly sized.


## Code

### React

A `TextField` component renders an input field as well as supporting UI elements like a label, error message, and hint text.

### Web Component
