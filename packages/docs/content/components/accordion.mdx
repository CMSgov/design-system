## Guidance

### When to use

- Use an accordion to see an overview of multiple, related sections of content
- Use an accordion to show and hide sections as needed

### When to consider alternatives

Accordions hide content from users and not everyone will notice them or understand how they work.
Accordions increase cognitive load and interaction cost, as users have to make decisions about what headers to click on.

- Don't use an accordion if users need to see most or all of the information on a page.
- Don't use an accordion if there is not enough content to warrant condensing.

### Usage

- Make the entire header selectable. Allow users to click anywhere in the header area to expand or collapse the content; a larger target is easier to manipulate.
- Give interactive elements enough space. Make sure interactive elements within the collapsible region are far enough from the headers that users don’t accidentally trigger a collapse.

## Accessibility

Keyboard support for the Accordion header includes:

- `Enter` or `Spacebar` - Changes the collapsed/expanded state of the associated accordion panel
- `Arrow Down` - Moves focus to the next accordion header
- `Arrow Up` - Moves focus to the previous accordion header

### Accessibility testing

#### Screen reader testing

When using a screen reader:

##### Focus states

- Focus moves in a logical order when using a screen reader. When you use a screen reader and navigate between accordion panels, the order in which the focus proceeds from item to item is logical. (For example, the focus doesn’t skip a link or accordion heading.)
- Focus indicator is visible when using a screen reader. When you use a screen reader and navigate between accordion panels, the virtual cursor (or JAWS focus) moves from one header to the next.
- Heading levels are logical. When you use a screen reader and navigate through the accordion panel headings, the heading levels are the correct level for the page outline.

##### Headings

- Heading levels are consistent. When you use a screen reader and navigate through the accordion panel headings, each accordion panel’s heading level is the same. (Typically this is a heading level 2 or 3.)
- Screen reader announces “collapsed” state. When you use a screen reader and navigate to a closed panel, the screen reader announces that the content is “collapsed.”
- Screen reader announces “expanded” state. When you use a screen reader and navigate to an open panel, the screen reader announces that the content is “expanded.”
- Screen reader announces “expanded” state with expected keys. When you use a screen reader and use the `Enter` key or the `Spacebar` on a closed panel, the screen reader announces that the content is “expanded.”
- Screen reader announces “collapsed” state with expected keys. When you use a screen reader and use the `Enter` key or the `Spacebar` on an open panel, the screen reader announces that the content is “collapsed.”

#### Keyboard testing

When navigating with a keyboard:

##### Accordion panel behavior

- Accordion panel opens with keyboard interaction. When you use the `Enter` key or the `Spacebar` on a closed panel, the panel opens (expands).
- Accordion panel closes with keyboard interaction. When you use the `Enter` key or the `Spacebar` on an open panel, the panel closes (collapses).
- Accordion panel does not toggle on hover. When you hover or focus on any accordion panel, the panel neither opens nor closes.

##### Interactive elements

- Interactive elements work after tabbing. When you use the `tab` key to navigate into an open accordion panel, each interactive item inside that panel (like a link) is selectable.

##### Focus states

- Focus moves out of the accordion without closing the panel. When you navigate out of the accordion, it does not close.
- Focus moves forward with keyboard interaction. When you navigate through items with the `Tab` key, the order in which the visible focus proceeds from item to item is logical. (For example, the focus doesn’t skip a link or accordion heading.)
- Focus moves backwards with keyboard interaction. When you navigate through items with `Shift` + `Tab`, the visible focus moves to the previous focusable elements without skipping any items.
- Focus stays on the panel header. When you use the `Enter` key or the `Spacebar` on a closed panel, the focus highlight stays on the panel header.
- Focus indicator is clear on the accordion panel. When you `Tab` onto an accordion panel, the focus highlight is clear and visible.
- Focus indicator is clear on interactive items. When you navigate through interactive content items (like links) with the `Tab` key, each item has a focus highlight that is clear and visible.
