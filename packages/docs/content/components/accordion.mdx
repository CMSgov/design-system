## Guidance

### When to use

- Use an accordion to see an overview of multiple, related sections of content
- Use an accordion to show and hide sections as needed

### When to consider alternatives

Accordions hide content from users and not everyone will notice them or understand how they work.
Accordions increase cognitive load and interaction cost, as users have to make decisions about what headers to click on.

- Don't use an accordion if users need to see most or all of the information on a page.
- Don't use an accordion if there is not enough content to warrant condensing.

### Usage

- Make the entire header selectable. Allow users to click anywhere in the header area to expand or collapse the content; a larger target is easier to manipulate.
- Give interactive elements enough space. Make sure interactive elements within the collapsible region are far enough from the headers that users donâ€™t accidentally trigger a collapse.

### Accessibility

Keyboard support for the Accordion header includes:

- `Enter` or `Spacebar` - Changes the collapsed/expanded state of the associated accordion panel
- `Arrow Down` - Moves focus to the next accordion header
- `Arrow Up` - Moves focus to the previous accordion header
