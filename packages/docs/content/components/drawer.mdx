title: Drawer & Help Drawer
intro: A drawer provides a space for medium to long-form help content — content that's too long or not common enough to warrant being on the page by default.

A `Drawer` is a component that provides a space for displaying medium to long-form content. It is designed to present information that may be too lengthy or too specific to be included on the page by default. The content can include a mix of text, HTML elements, or other components, allowing for flexibility in displaying information such as forms, images, links, or lists.

The `HelpDrawer` extends the `Drawer` by adding analytics capabilities, which can help track user interactions, making it a great choice for situations where gathering insights on how users engage with help content is important.

## Examples

<ThemeContent neverThemes={['medicare']}>

<StorybookExample componentName="drawer" storyId="components-drawer--default" minHeight={500} />

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

<StorybookExample
  componentName="drawer"
  storyId="medicare-helpdrawer--help-drawer-toggle-with-drawer"
  minHeight={500}
/>

</ThemeContent>

### Layout Alternatives

A header and/or footer can have a "sticky" position if the following properties are applied to their respective elements:

- `isHeaderSticky`
- `isFooterSticky`

<StorybookExample
  componentName="sticky-drawer"
  storyId="components-drawer--default"
  minHeight={300}
  controls="isHeaderSticky:!true"
/>

### Managing multiple drawers

What do you do when there are multiple drawers on a page? The simplest behavior—which may not be appropriate for all use cases—is that when one drawer opens, any open drawers get closes. While this logic can be written into your application, [we have a React component to manage simple drawer behavior](/storybook/?path=/docs/components-drawermanager--docs).

## Code

### React

<ReactDocsLinks>
  <ReactDocsLink storyId="components-drawer--docs">Drawer</ReactDocsLink>
  <ReactDocsLink storyId="components-helpdawer--docs">Help Drawer</ReactDocsLink>
</ReactDocsLinks>

### Style customization

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize Drawer components:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="drawer" />

### Analytics

This component has analytics tracking available. Please see our developer documentation about [using analytics in the design system](/getting-started/for-developers/#analytics).

## Guidance

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

- All help drawer links will include a help icon with the link to indicate the link is a help option.

</ThemeContent>

### When to use 
`Drawer`

- When users need additional information that should remain viewable while they interact with the main page, such as detailed explanations, guidelines, or interactive elements like forms.
- When supplementary, non-time-sensitive information is helpful at a specific point in the user’s journey but does not need to be displayed on the main page. This allows users to access helpful context or additional details at their discretion without interrupting the flow of the main task.
- When optional information is needed to complete a task without overwhelming the primary content on the page.

`HelpDrawer`
- When you need to track how users interact with the content, such as monitoring how often the drawer is opened or engaged with.

### When to Consider Alternatives

- When the information is timely, urgent, or critical to the action being taken. Drawers are intended for supplementary details that users can access at their discretion. For time-sensitive or essential information, consider using more prominent inline elements to ensure users don’t miss it.
- When the information needs to be immediately visible to clarify or support a primary task. Since `Drawers` require an extra step to open, they are not ideal for essential information that users must see to complete a task or understand other content.
- When the information must be displayed automatically without user initiation. `Drawers` rely on users clicking a link or button to open them. If content needs to appear automatically, such as onboarding tips or error messages, consider inline options that don’t require user action.

### Usage

- Link text used to trigger the `Drawer` should be specific and descriptive.
  - Avoid using only "Learn more" to link to help `Drawer` content.
  - Limit the amount of link text.
- `Drawer` content area should include a close button clearly at the top.
- On larger screens, the `Drawer` is fixed to the side of the screen, whereas on smaller screens, it overlays the entire screen.

### Accessibility

- The `Drawer` should have an `aria-labelledby` attribute that references the `id` of the heading in the `Drawer`.
- The `Drawer` markup should be placed after the toggle element that triggers it in the HTML structure. This keeps the markup semantically sound and improves accessibility for screen readers.
- The heading level used within the `Drawer` should fit semantically with the heading levels of the rest of the page. For instance, if the heading level before the `Drawer` toggle link is an `<h2>`, the heading level of the `Drawer` would most likely be an `<h3>`.

#### Focus Management

- Focus should move to the content in the Drawer after the user has opened it.
- The property `hasFocusTrap` is an available option that will prevent keyboard focus from leaving the confines of the Drawer when enabled.

When `hasFocusTrap` is enabled...

- Keyboard focus is trapped within the Drawer component.
- Pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd> will close the Drawer.

A focus trap should _not_ be used when it's anticipated that the user will rely on the Drawer as a reference resource for doing something outside of the Drawer. For instance, if the user is completing a form, Drawer may contain a reference guide defining specific requirements on the page.However, there are times when it makes sense to trap focus within the Drawer. One occasion where it can benefit the user is when the Drawer is anticipated to fill the viewport of a screen, e.g., in a mobile layout.

#### Accessibility testing

##### Keyboard

- I can use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus to the Drawer toggle button.
- I can use <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> to toggle the Drawer open or closed.
- When the Drawer is open, I can use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus to the close button, then sequentially through the list of focusable items.
- There's a visible focus ring as I move through interactive content in the Drawer, first to the close button, then sequentially through the list of focusable items.
- If `hasFocusTrap` is enabled, then...
  - ...pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd> will close the Drawer.
  - ...I can't move focus outside of the Drawer.
- If `hasFocusTrap` is not set, then...
  - ...I can move focus outside of the Drawer.

##### Screen reader

- The Drawer toggle indicates the purpose of the Drawer and mirrors the first heading inside the Drawer.
- When the Drawer is open:
  - Focus is sent to the Drawer.
  - The Drawer's role of `dialog` is read.
  - The Drawer's first heading element is announced.

###### Mobile

- Double-tapping the Drawer toggle...
  - ...sends focus to the Drawer.
  - ...reads the Drawer's role of `dialog`.
  - ...announces the Drawer's first heading element.
- Double-tapping the Drawer's close button sends focus back to the Drawer toggle and the toggle label is read.
