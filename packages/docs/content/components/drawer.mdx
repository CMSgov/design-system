title: Drawer & Help Drawer
intro: A drawer provides a space for medium to long-form help content — content that's too long or not common enough to warrant being on the page by default.

On large screens it's fixed to the side of the screen, and on smaller screens it overlays the entire screen.

Render the drawer below the toggle button that triggers it. This way the markup remains semantically sound and screen reader friendly.

## Examples

<ThemeContent neverThemes={['medicare']}>

<StorybookExample componentName="drawer" storyId="components-drawer--default" minHeight={500} />

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

<StorybookExample
  componentName="drawer"
  storyId="medicare-helpdrawer--help-drawer-toggle-with-drawer"
  minHeight={500}
/>

</ThemeContent>

### Layout Alternatives

A header and/or footer can have a "sticky" position if the following properties are applied to their respective elements:

- `isHeaderSticky`
- `isFooterSticky`

<StorybookExample
  componentName="sticky-drawer"
  storyId="components-drawer--default"
  minHeight={300}
  controls="isHeaderSticky:!true"
/>

### Managing multiple drawers

What do you do when there are multiple drawers on a page? The simplest behavior—which may not be appropriate for all use cases—is that when one drawer opens, any open drawers get closes. While this logic can be written into your application, [we have a React component to manage simple drawer behavior](/storybook/?path=/docs/components-drawermanager--docs).

## Code

### React

<StorybookDocLinks>
  <StorybookDocLink storyId="components-drawer--docs">Drawer</StorybookDocLink>
  <StorybookDocLink storyId="components-helpdrawer--docs">Help Drawer</StorybookDocLink>
</StorybookDocLinks>

### Web Component

<StorybookDocLinks tech="wc">
  <StorybookDocLink tech="wc" storyId="web-components-ds-drawer--docs">Drawer</StorybookDocLink>
</StorybookDocLinks>

### Style customization

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize Drawer components:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="drawer" />

### Analytics

This component has analytics tracking available. Please see our developer documentation about [using analytics in the design system](/getting-started/for-developers/#analytics).

## Guidance

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

- All help drawer links will include a help icon with the link to indicate the link is a help option.
- All help drawer links are clickable.

</ThemeContent>

### When to use

- When users need content to remain viewable while also allowing the user to view and/or interact with the main page.
- When the content is longer than 2 sentences.
- When the content needs to be available at a particular point in the process, but doesn't need to be included on the main page.
- When the content just needs to be available at the user's discretion, to provide additional details or context.
- When users may need additional information to complete the task than can be supplied on the main page without overwhelming the primary content.

### When to consider alternatives

- When the content is timely/urgent, or critical to the action being taken.
- When the content is intended to clarify or call attention to other content on the page.
- When the content must be displayed without being initiated by a user action.
- When additional information is necessary to the primary information the user is interacting with.

### Usage

- Link text used to trigger the help drawer should be specific and descriptive.
  - Avoid using only "Learn more" to link to help drawer content
  - Limit the amount of link text
- Drawer content area should include a close button clearly at the top.

### Accessibility

- Drawer should have an `aria-labelledby` attribute that references the `id` of heading in the Drawer.
- The heading level used within the Drawer should fit semantically with the heading levels of the rest of the page. For instance, if the heading level before the Drawer toggle link is an `<h2>`, the heading level of the Drawer would most likely be an `<h3>`.

#### Focus Management

- Focus should move to the content in the Drawer after the user has opened it.
- The property `hasFocusTrap` is an available option that will prevent keyboard focus from leaving the confines of the Drawer when enabled.

When `hasFocusTrap` is enabled...

- Keyboard focus is trapped within the Drawer component.
- Pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd> will close the Drawer.

A focus trap should _not_ be used when it's anticipated that the user will rely on the Drawer as a reference resource for doing something outside of the Drawer. For instance, if the user is completing a form, Drawer may contain a reference guide defining specific requirements on the page.However, there are times when it makes sense to trap focus within the Drawer. One occasion where it can benefit the user is when the Drawer is anticipated to fill the viewport of a screen, e.g., in a mobile layout.

#### Accessibility testing

##### Keyboard

- I can use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus to the Drawer toggle button.
- I can use <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> to toggle the Drawer open or closed.
- When the Drawer is open, I can use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus to the close button, then sequentially through the list of focusable items.
- There's a visible focus ring as I move through interactive content in the Drawer, first to the close button, then sequentially through the list of focusable items.
- If `hasFocusTrap` is enabled, then...
  - ...pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd> will close the Drawer.
  - ...I can't move focus outside of the Drawer.
- If `hasFocusTrap` is not set, then...
  - ...I can move focus outside of the Drawer.

##### Screen reader

- The Drawer toggle indicates the purpose of the Drawer and mirrors the first heading inside the Drawer.
- When the Drawer is open:
  - Focus is sent to the Drawer.
  - The Drawer's role of `dialog` is read.
  - The Drawer's first heading element is announced.

###### Mobile

- Double-tapping the Drawer toggle...
  - ...sends focus to the Drawer.
  - ...reads the Drawer's role of `dialog`.
  - ...announces the Drawer's first heading element.
- Double-tapping the Drawer's close button sends focus back to the Drawer toggle and the toggle label is read.
