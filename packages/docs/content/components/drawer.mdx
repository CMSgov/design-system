title: Drawer & Help Drawer
intro: A drawer provides a space for medium to long-form help content — content that's too long or not common enough to warrant being on the page by default.

On large screens it's fixed to the side of the screen, and on smaller screens it overlays the entire screen.

Render the drawer below the toggle button that triggers it. This way the markup remains semantically sound and screen reader friendly.

## Examples

<ThemeContent neverThemes={['medicare']}>

<StorybookExample
  componentName="drawer"
  storyId="components-drawer--drawer-toggle-with-drawer"
  minHeight={500}
/>

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

<StorybookExample
  componentName="drawer"
  storyId="medicare-help-drawer--help-drawer-toggle-with-drawer"
  minHeight={500}
/>

</ThemeContent>

### Layout Alternatives

A header and/or footer can have a "sticky" position if the following properties are applied to their respective elements:

- `isHeaderSticky`
- `isFooterSticky`

<StorybookExample
  componentName="sticky-drawer"
  storyId="components-drawer--drawer-with-sticky-positioning"
  minHeight={300}
/>

### Managing multiple drawers

If you have multiple `<Drawer>`'s on a page, you can utilize the `<DrawerManager>` context provider along with the `useDrawerManager()` hook to manage the state of these drawers so that only one will remain open at a time. The hook provides functions to toggle state of the drawer via click, to close the drawer and to get the open status of the drawer. A minimal example of implementation:

```js
import { DrawerManager, useDrawerManager } from '@cmsgov/design-system';

const ManagedDrawer = (props) => {
  const { toggleClick, closeClick, isOpen } = useDrawerManager();

  return (
    <>
      {isOpen && (
        <Drawer onCloseClick={closeClick} {...props} />
      )}
      <Button
        className="ds-c-drawer__toggle"
        variation="ghost"
        onClick={toggleClick}
      >
        Toggle {props.heading}
      </Button>
    </>
  )
}

export default function App() {
  <DrawerManager>
    ... any content
    <ManagedDrawer {...propsForDrawer1} />
    <ManagedDrawer {...propsForDrawer2} />
    <ManagedDrawer {...propsForDrawer3} />
  </DrawerManager>
}
```

Since this component utilizes React `Context`, any number of components/content items can be within the `DrawerManager` provider and will not be effected by it.

## Code

### React

<PropTable componentName="Drawer" />

#### `<DrawerToggle>`

<PropTable componentName="DrawerToggle" />

#### `<HelpDrawer>`

This component is an enhanced `<Drawer>` component, providing the same properties as `<Drawer>` in addition to Google Analytics properties.

<PropTable componentName="HelpDrawer" hasAnalytics />

#### Focus Trap

A focus trap can be set on a drawer if the property `hasFocusTrap` is enabled. A user can escape the focus trap by pressing the <kbd>ESC</kbd> key.

### Styles

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize Drawer components:

<ComponentThemeOptions
  componentname="drawer"
/>

### Analytics

This component has analytics tracking available. Please see our developer documentation about [using analytics in the design system](/getting-started/for-developers/#analytics).

## Guidance

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

- All help drawer links will include a help icon with the link to indicate the link is a help option.
- All help drawer links are clickable.

</ThemeContent>

### When to use

- When users need content to remain viewable while also allowing the user to views/interacts with the main page.
- When the content is longer than 2 sentences.
- When the content needs to be available at a particular point in the process, but doesn't need to be included on the main page.
- When the content just needs to be available at the user's discretion, to provide additional details or context.
- When users may need additional information to complete the task than can be supplied on the main page without overwhelming the primary content.

### When to consider alternatives

- When the content is timely/urgent, or critical to the action being taken.
- When the content is intended to clarify or call attention to other content on the page.
- When the content must be displayed without being initiated by a user action.
- When additional information is necessary to the primary information the user is interacting with.

### Usage

- Link text used to trigger the help drawer should be specific and descriptive.
  - Avoid using only "Learn more" to link to help drawer content
  - Limit the amount of link text
- Drawer content area should include a close button clearly at the top.

### Accessibility

- Focus should move to the content in the help drawer after the user has opened it.
- Drawer should support keyboard navigation.
  - `Enter` and `Space` to select the highlighted item.
  - `Tab` to move the focus sequentially through the list of focusable items
  - `Shift + Tab` to move the focus sequentially through the list of focusable items in reversed order

#### Focus Management

The property `hasFocusTrap` is an available option that will prevent keyboard focus from leaving the confines of the HelpDrawer when enabled.

When the property `hasFocusTrap` is enabled...

- Keyboard focus is trapped within the HelpDrawer component.
- Pressing the escape key will close the Drawer.

A focus trap should _not_ be used when it's anticipated that the user will rely on the Drawer as a reference resource for doing something outside of the Drawer. For instance, if the user is completing a form, Drawer may contain a reference guide defining specific requirements.

However, there are times when it makes sense to trap focus within the Drawer. One occassion where it can benefit the user is when the Drawer is anticipated to fill the viewport of a screen, i.e., mobile layout.
