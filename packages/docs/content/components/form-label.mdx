## Examples

The `FormLabel` component provides the `label` (or `legend`) for a field, along with any associated hint text and error message.

<StorybookExample
  componentName="formLabel"
  sourceFilePath="components/FormLabel/FormLabel.tsx"
  storyId="components-formlabel--form-label-with-hint"
/>

## Code

### React

<PropTable componentName="ChoiceList" />

### Styles

The following Sass variables can be overridden to customize Form components:

<ComponentThemeOptions
  componentname="form"
/>

## Guidance

### When to use

#### Labels

- Each form field should have a `<label>`. Never use a field's placeholder attribute as the primary way to label the field.

#### Legends

- Use a single legend for fieldset (this is required). One example of a common use of fieldset and legend is a question with radio button options for answers. The question text and radio buttons are wrapped in a fieldset, with the question itself being inside the legend tag.

### Usage

#### Labels

- Each form field should have a clear, brief, and descriptive label.
- Labels should have a `for` attribute, referencing the corresponding input's unique `id` attribute. Only one label can be associated to each unique form element.
- Labels should be placed above their fields.
- Label text should be short and in sentence case.
- Avoid colons at the end of labels.
- Don't use a field's placeholder attribute as the primary way to label the field.

#### Legends

- Avoid links in legends when possible. Links inside legends are not read by some screen readers, most notably Internet Explorer 11, paired with JAWS. If you need a pattern like this, put the link outside of the legend element, but keep all other useful hint text in the legend.

#### Hint text

- Place hint text within the field's `<label>` element.
- Apply the `.ds-c-field__hint` class to hint text.
- Use hint text for supporting contextual help, which will always be shown.
- Hint text should sit above a form field and below the label text.
