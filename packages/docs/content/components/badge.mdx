## Guidance

### When to use

- To draw attention to new, important content on a page that might otherwise be missed.
- To filter results with one or more tags.
- To indicate the number of new or unread items within a container. For example, to indicate the number of unread messages within a person’s inbox.

### When to consider alternatives

- When users are likely to confuse a badge with a button. For example, when the badge appears in the same area of the page as buttons.
- To call attention to new or updated content, consider changing the background color of the object itself or experiment with changing the font weight.
- When users already expect content to be updated frequently. For example, on a site dedicated to breaking news. In this case placing the new content at the top may be enough.

### Usage

- Don’t overdo it — if everything on a page is called out as important, nothing is important.
- Users may confuse badges as buttons. Always conduct usability testing to make sure your particular implementation is not causing frustration.
- Don’t mix interactive and static badges on your site. Once you establish a pattern for how badges behave, users will expect that behavior every time.

### Accessibility

- When badges are used to call out new content that is dynamically loaded onto a page, be sure to use [ARIA live regions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) to alert screen readers of the change.

### Future research

- Further usability testing should be done to ensure badges aren't being confused with buttons. Further iteration can be done with sizing and colors if there is confusion.
