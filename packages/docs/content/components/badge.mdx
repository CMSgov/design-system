## Guidance

### When to use

- To draw attention to new, important content on a page that might otherwise be missed.
- To filter results with one or more tags.
- To indicate the number of new or unread items within a container. For example, to indicate the number of unread messages within a person’s inbox.

### When to consider alternatives

- When users are likely to confuse a badge with a button. For example, when the badge appears in the same area of the page as buttons.
- To call attention to new or updated content, consider changing the background color of the object itself or experiment with changing the font weight.
- When users already expect content to be updated frequently. For example, on a site dedicated to breaking news. In this case placing the new content at the top may be enough.

### Usage

- Don’t overdo it — if everything on a page is called out as important, nothing is important.
- Users may confuse badges as buttons. Always conduct usability testing to make sure your particular implementation is not causing frustration.
- Don’t mix interactive and static badges on your site. Once you establish a pattern for how badges behave, users will expect that behavior every time.

## Accessibility

The Badge component has been tested against, and meets, WCAG 2.0 standards for text size, color contrast, and screen reader usage.

### Accessibility

When badges are used to call out new content that is dynamically loaded onto a page, be sure to use ARIA live regions to alert screen readers of the change.

### Accessibility testing

#### Screen reader testing

- Screen readers should announce the badge’s alert status (e.g., `Info`, `Warning`, `Error`, `Success`), followed by its text content
- When used in an ARIA live region, the screen reader should alert users to the changed content

#### Keyboard testing

Badges are not interactive by default, so they should not get focus and should not show focus rings.
