## Guidance

#### Content

- Describe what the user needs to do when the field is selected
- Use a phrase or complete sentence
- Start with an action verb and pair it with a noun to help it be clearer. Example: Enter your age.
- Use the fewest words possible (i.e. don't use "please")
- Use sentence case
- Be consistent with punctuation at the end of a phrase or sentence
- Be consistent with phrase and sentence structure

### Hint text

- Place hint text within the field's `<label>` element.
- Place hint text where appropriate depending on what content it's helping to explain
- Use hint text for supporting contextual help, which will always be shown.
- Hint text should sit between a form label and the input.
- Use lower visual style (i.e., lighter gray than the form label or the input option) so it won't compete for users' attention with the field label.
- Use hint text to indicate which inputs are optional when there are more required fields than optional.
- Hint text can also appear after an input box when the text is being used to show the value someone should be entering in the field (e.g., income amount input box displays text after the input box to highlight the amount should be "monthly income".)

#### Content

- Use when appropriate to support a form label (Goes below the form label in a lighter weight font)
- Describe how to best answer the question/form label
- Use the fewest words possible (i.e. don't use "please")
- Use sentence case
- End with a period
