## Examples

<StorybookExample componentName="filterChip" storyId="components-filterchip--multiple-chips" />

## Guidance

### When to use

- Use to clearly indicate to the user what filters have been applied to a set of results and provide a quick and easy way to remove a selected filter

### When to consider alternatives

- When many filter chips would be displayed and available screen real estate is limited
- When a badge is sufficient in place of a filter chip

### Usage

- Do not mix badges and filter chip as it can be confusing to the user
- Do not use filter chip when a badge is sufficient, i.e., when none of the tags are removable
- Filter chips should be short and not wrap to the second line
- Allow adequate spacing (at least 8px) between each filter chip, as much as the design will allow.
- The colors of the Filter Chip can be overriden using the CSS variables listed below, but should not be overriden with colors outside of the color palette.

## Accessibility

The filter chip component has been tested against, and meets, WCAG 2.0 standards for size, color contrast, and screen reader usage.

- The filter chip itself does not need a label, as the text content within it is sufficient. However, actions that the filter can take (like remove) do need to be labelled and you should take advantage of the ariaClearLabel prop to do so. That prop will provide additional text for screen reader support.
- The chip should receive focus.
- `Enter`, `Backspace`, and `Delete` will remove the tag when it is in focus.

### Accessibility testing

#### Screen reader testing

- When navigating to a filter chip, screen readers should announce the label text and any actions (like remove) separately.
- Screen readers should identify filter chips as buttons.

#### Keyboard testing

- Users should be able to navigate to the chip with their keyboard.
- Filter chips should receive focus.
- `Enter`, `Backspace`, and `Delete` should remove the tag or otherwise trigger the filter action when it is in focus.
