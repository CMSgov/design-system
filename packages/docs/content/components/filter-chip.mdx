## Examples

<StorybookExample componentName="filterChip" storyId="components-filterchip--multiple-chips" />

## Code

### React

<SeeStorybookForReactGuidance storyId={'components-filterchip--docs'} />

### Styles

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize FilterChip components:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="filter-chip" />

## Guidance

### When to use

- Use to clearly indicate to the user what filters have been applied to a set of results and provide a quick and easy way to remove a selected filter

### When to consider alternatives

- When many filter chips would be displayed and available screen real estate is limited
- When a badge is sufficient in place of a filter chip

### Usage

- Do not mix badges and filter chip as it can be confusing to the user
- Do not use filter chip when a badge is sufficient, i.e., when none of the tags are removable
- Filter chips should be short and not wrap to the second line
- Allow adequate spacing (at least 8px) between each filter chip, as much as the design will allow.
- The colors of the Filter Chip can be overriden using the CSS variables listed below, but should not be overriden with colors outside of the color palette.

### Accessibility

- `Enter`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, and `Spacebar` will remove the tag when it is in focus
