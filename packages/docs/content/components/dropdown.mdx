## Examples

<StorybookExample componentName="dropdown" storyId="components-dropdown--default" minHeight={250} />

## Code

### React

Note that any _undocumented_ props that you pass to this component will be passed to the `select` element, so you can use this to set additional attributes if necessary.

<SeeStorybookForGuidance storyId={'components-dropdown--docs'} />

### Style customization

The following CSS variables can be overridden to customize Dropdown components:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="dropdown" />

#### Text Input Options

This component also makes use of some text input styles, which can be customized by the following variables:

<ComponentThemeOptions componentname="text-input" />

## Guidance

### When to use

- **Use sparingly**. Use the dropdown component only when a user needs to choose from about seven to 15 possible options and you have limited space to display the options.

### When to consider alternatives

- **Fewer than seven options.** Use [radio buttons](/components/radio) or [checkboxes](/components/checkbox/) instead.
- **More than 15 options.** If the list of options is very long. Let users type the same information into a text input that suggests possible options instead.
- **Multi-select.** If you need to allow users to select more than one option at once. Users often don’t understand how to select multiple items from dropdowns. Use [checkboxes]({{root}}/components/choice) instead.
- **Site navigation.** Use the [navigation components](/components/vertical-nav/) instead.

### Usage

- **Always use a label.** Make sure your dropdown has a label. Don’t replace it with the default menu option (for example, removing the “State” label and just having the dropdown read “Select a state” by default).
- **Make sure to test.** Test dropdowns thoroughly with members of your target audience. Several usability experts suggest they should be the “UI of last resort.” Many users find them confusing and difficult to use.
- **Use a good default.** When most users will (or should) pick a particular option, make it the selected default. **If a good default is not an option**, use a descriptive placeholder like `- Select a state -` as the selected default.
- **Avoid using dropdown to change context.** Don't automatically change content on the page or navigate when a user selects a different value. [According to WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/on-input), you should warn users if changing a form control changes context.
- **Avoid dependent options.** Avoid making options in one dropdown menu change based on the input to another. Users often don’t understand how selecting an item in one impacts another.
- **Order alphabetically.** Present the options in alphabetical order as the default ordering when possible.

### Accessibility testing

#### General observations

- The dropdown list should be closed by default.
- When the dropdown list is displayed, `aria-expanded` is set to `true` and, conversely, set to `false` when the listbox is closed.
- The dropdown button contains `aria-haspopup="listbox"`, while the listbox contains a `role="listbox"`.
- The dropdown button contains an `aria-controls` attribute which maps to an `id` on the listbox.
- Selected option text that is longer than the dropdown button will be truncated, but the full text of that option will be displayed on multiple lines in the dropdown list.

#### Keyboard Testing

- When the Dropdown is closed and has focus
  - Users can open the listbox by pressing <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Down</kbd>, <kbd>Up</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Up</kbd> or <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Down</kbd>. When the listbox opens it highlights the current option
  - If a user begins typing then the listbox will open and will highlight the first option that matches the typed character.
  - If the same character is typed in succession, visual focus cycles among the options starting with that character.
- When the Dropdown is open
  - <kbd>Escape</kbd> key closes the options, sets visual focus on the combobox, and retains the current
    value.
  - <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> keys should cycle through options.
  - <kbd>Enter</kbd> key selects the currently focused option and closes the menu.
  - <kbd>Space</kbd> key selects the currently focused option and closes the menu.
  - If the same character is typed in succession, visual focus cycles among the options starting with that character.
  - <kbd>Home</kbd> key moves visual focus to the first option.
  - <kbd>End</kbd> key moves visual focus to the last option.

#### Screen reader testing

- When I navigate to the Dropdown
  - If hints or errors are present, they are read.
- When the listbox is displayed
  - I use the arrow keys to select an option and I hear the selected option is changed.
  - I select an option with the Enter or Space key and hear the selected option.

<!-- [We need to implement this] I use the escape key and I hear it collapse and focus moves to the select -->

#### Mobile screen reader testing

- I can swipe to focus on the component.
- I can hear the purpose of the element.
- It identifies itself as a combobox.
- I hear hints or errors are read.
- I hear it indicate which option is selected.

#### Pointer device testing

- I select anywhere inside the the dropdown button to display or hide the listbox.
- I select an option by clicking anywhere inside the option list.
- I select an option and the `aria-selected` attribute is added to the currently selected option.
- If using a mouse, a hover state (highlighted state) is visible over each non-selected list options as I drag the mouse over them.
- I select an option and that option is displayed in the dropdown component and the listbox is hidden.
- I select anywhere outside the component to close the listbox when it is displaying.
