## Examples

<StorybookExample componentName="medicareLogo" storyId="medicare-logo--logo" />

## Guidance

## Accessibility

- Logos used in the header and footer are considered functional images per the W3C.

### General accessibility guidance

- Logos in the header and footer, or that function as links, should be given alternative text that tells the user where clicking the logo will take them – in our case, usually the homepage. 
- Logos used in the header and footer, or that function as links, should be given focus when navigating by keyboard.

### Accessibility testing

- Alternate text is visible when you hover over the logo
- Clicking the logo shows a focus state

#### Keyboard testing

- The logo receives focus via keyboard navigation. Using only a keyboard, you can navigate to the logo, use it to go to the appropriate link, and navigate away from it.
- Focus indicators are clearly visible around logos. When you use a keyboard to tab into a text input, you see an indicator around the input field.

#### Screenreader testing

- Alternative text is read aloud by screenreaders.
- Screenreader announces that it is on a link, and the link’s destination.
