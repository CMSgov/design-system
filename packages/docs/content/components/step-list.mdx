## Examples

The `StepList` component is the preferred method for building a step list, since it handles all the state logic necessary to produce its markup. A step is represented by an object with text, progress, and routing information and can optionally include an array of substeps as well as a description.

### Accessibility

### Accessibility testing

#### General accessibility testing
- Check that each step has a clear and unique label so that users understand the purpose and sequence of steps.
- Ensure that focus is managed correctly when steps are completed or when the user moves from one step to the next.
- Verify that the component layout does not break or hide important information when viewed on different devices.

#### Keyboard testing
- Verify that users can navigate through any links in the steps using only the keyboard (e.g., Tab, Shift+Tab, and Enter/Space keys).
- Confirm that focus is clearly visible on each step and that the order of steps is logical.

#### Screenreader testing
- Use a screen reader (such as NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver) to test how the step indicator is announced.
- Ensure that visually hidden text and ARIA labels are properly read, clearly conveying the completion status and position of each step.
- Confirm that any indicators or icons that are hidden from screen readers (using `aria-hidden="true"`) do not interfere with the announcement of - the step information.
