<StorybookExample
  componentName="step-list"
  storyId="patterns-third-party-external-link--third-party-external-link"
  minHeight={450}

## Guidance

Use this pattern when the user is in the middle of a task or application to let them know that the action they are taking will move them away from the current site and or process. This serves as a warning where the user can then decide to remain where they are in the application or process.

**Any non .gov and .mil links will be treated as external whether they belong to a government agency or not, no exceptions**
