The design system favors clarity over succinctness. This means the design system may be verbose, but it should deliver clarity, predictability, and legibility in exchange.

## CSS class naming convention

### Namespace

To avoid conflicting with other libraries and existing code, the design system namespaces its CSS class names with `ds-`.

### Prefix

Prefixes are added to class names to make it more apparent what job the class is doing.

| Prefix | Description                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `l-`   | Indicates layout-related styles. Example: `.ds-l-container` |
| `c-`   | Indicates a component. Example: `.ds-c-button`              |
| `u-`   | Indicates a utility. Example: `.ds-u-color--base`           |

These prefixes can sometimes be followed by a "breakpoint prefix". [Learn more about breakpoint prefixes.](/foundation/layout-grid/responsive-design/)

### BEM syntax

Following the namespace and prefix is a name conforming to [BEM syntax](http://getbem.com/introduction/).

Put all together, a CSS class can be broken down to these key parts: `[NAMESPACE]-[PREFIX]-[BLOCK]__[ELEMENT]--[MODIFIER]`

- **Block** is a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. For example: `.ds-c-card`, `.ds-c-button`
- **Element** is a part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block, such as `.ds-c-card__title`
- **Modifier** is a flag on a block or element and is used to change appearance or behavior. For example: `.ds-c-button--primary`, `.ds-u-color--base`, `.ds-l-col--3`
