title: Migrating to v4 Buttons
order: 60
---

import { Button } from '@cmsgov/design-system';

The CMS Design System v4 release introduces an updated button architecture that is not backwards compatible with previous versions of the design system. Please review the following sections to become acquianted with our new buttons and how to migrate your code.

## The new buttons

In order to more consistently apply design token values across our core and child design systems, we now describe button variations by how they look rather than what their role is in a brand. Because different brands can apply different meanings to each of the styles of buttons we offer, we needed a more consistent way of naming buttons as we move towards a unified design system that can be themed by brand.

Below are two tables showing the complete set of buttons available in v4. **Use the doc site's theme selector** to see what buttons are available in the child design systems.

## Mapping old buttons to new buttons

While we have provided **automatic migration scripts** as part of this migration guide, it is helpful to know how the old button variations in your app are mapped to the new button architecture. The following tables show how to map buttons defined in React code or in plain HTML with CSS classes. Note that you can **use the doc site's theme selector** to see the buttons that are specific to your brand.

## Migration scripts

Migration help has been provided via the `cmsds-migrate` helper script. If you include the `@cmsgov/design-system@ver` package in your project the script is usable by executing the following command from the command line:

`yarn cmsds-migrate` or `npx cmsds-migrate`

After executing this you will be provided with a list of migration modules to utilize which are named descriptively by function, like this:

\```
 file: 
‚ùØ html-button-migration.mjs 
  migration-notice-cleanup.mjs 
  react-button-migration.mjs 
\```

If your project is written in React, use the `react-button-migration` option; if you use plain HTML with CSS classes, choose the `html-button-migration` option. After choosing a migration configuration, the script will search your current working directory for files that match the pre-defined rules for migration, and it will present a description of the changes to occur. Finally, it will list all the files to be modified, and after verification by prompt, it will execute the migration. **Please be sure to only run these scripts in a git repo where changes can be backed out if incorrect.** For cases that require some additional human attention, the script will place a comment near the change that it made. These comments can be cleaned up automatically using the `migration-notice-cleanup` migration configuration.

There are a number of command line options available by passing the flag `--help`. These include the ability to provide the current working directory, add additional ignore globs, force execution without prompting and pass an arbitrary configuration module to the script. The list of configuration modules provided is stored in the `@cmsgov/design-system` package under `scripts/cmsds-migrate/configs`.
