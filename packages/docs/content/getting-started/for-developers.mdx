Greetings, Developers! This page will walk you through all the basics of using the design system, but you might want to take a look at [our example projects on GitHub](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/main/examples/) as well.

As you go through this documentation, keep in mind that CMS Design System is a [family of design systems](/getting-started/child-design-systems/), and each of these design systems is distributed under a different package name:

- [**design-system**](?theme=core) - Core Design System
- [**ds-healthcare-gov**](?theme=healthcare) - Healthcare.gov Child Design System
- [**ds-medicare-gov**](?theme=medicare) - Medicare.gov Child Design System

We hope this page provides you with everything you need to get started with the design system, but if you run into trouble, [please reach out](/contact). If you have specific suggestions for how we can improve these docs, please feel free to edit this page (with the link under the table of contents) and submit a pull request!

## Getting the design system assets

How you get the design system assets depends on the needs of your project and your workstyle. You could...

1. [Install the npm package](#option-1-install-using-npm)
    - Good option if your project already uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management
    - Makes it easy to get patch updates for your major/minor version
2. [Reference files directly from the CDN](#option-2-reference-assets-from-the-cdn)
    - Good option if your project doesn't use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
    - CDN files are versioned, so you always know what version you're using, and those files will be cached by the client's browser
3. [Download the design system assets directly from GitHub](#option-3-download-assets-directly)
    - This is not recommended, but it's available if no other options will work for your project

### Option 1: Install using npm

If you already have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) set up for your project, you can add it to your list of dependencies using one of the commands below. **Note that the following example will display a different package name depending on the theme you have selected.**

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['core']}>

```sh
npm install --save @cmsgov/design-system
# or
yarn add @cmsgov/design-system
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

```sh
npm install --save @cmsgov/ds-healthcare-gov
# or
yarn add @cmsgov/ds-healthcare-gov
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

```sh
npm install --save @cmsgov/ds-medicare-gov
# or
yarn add @cmsgov/ds-medicare-gov
```

</ThemeContent>

#### Package file structure

The npm package includes:

- Pre-compiled SCSS files
- Compiled CSS files
- Compiled React components (CommonJS and ES modules)
- Typescript definition files
- Fonts and images

The `dist` folder contains all the necessary files in the design system, your project should not be importing anything from `src`.

```
└── dist
    ├── components/
    │   └── index.js        Compiled JS entry point (CommmonJS)
    ├── css/
    │   └── index.css       Compiled CSS entry point
    ├── esnext/
    │   └── index.esm.js    Compiled JS entry point (ES Module)
    ├── fonts/
    ├── images/
    ├── scss/
    │   ├── base/           Base styles, HTML element selectors
    │   ├── components/     Component styles
    │   ├── settings/       Variables, mixins, and functions
    │   ├── utilities/      Utility classes for individual CSS properties
    │   └── index.scss      Precompiled SCSS entry point
    └── types/              Typescript definition files
```

### Option 2: Reference assets from the CDN

A content delivery network (CDN) is a collection of servers that dynamically allocate resources dependent on the requester's geographic location in order to optimize the distribution of assets.

Some benefits and applications for utilizing the design system via CDN are:

- Quickly utilize design system code and style assets for development/prototyping
- The CDN caches assets for fast loading and scales automatically in case of a large number of requests
- Ability to utilize a specific version of the design system easily

#### Packages

Packages which are currently available for reference:

- **design-system** - The core CMSDS (versions 3.4.0 and above)
- **ds-healthcare-gov** - Healthcare.gov themed DS (versions 7.4.0 and above)
- **ds-medicare-gov** - Medicare.gov themed DS (versions 5.4.0 and above)

#### URL structure

```
https://design.cms.gov/cdn/<package-name>/<version>/<resource>
```

Where `package-name` is one of the packages named above, `version` is the version number and `resource` is the file being requested from the resources listed above.

#### Resources

```
  ├── css/
  │   ├── index.css
  │   ├── base/index.css
  │   ├── components/index.css
  │   └── utilities/index.css
  └── js/
      ├── react.production.min.js
      ├── react-dom.production.min.js
      └── bundle.js
```

#### Example for including version 3.4.0 Core CSS via CDN

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/design-system/3.4.0/css/index.css" crossorigin="anonymous" />
```

#### Example for including version 3.4.0 Core JS via CDN

If you do not already have React and React-DOM included in your page, include them before the design system js bundle.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/design-system/3.4.0/js/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/design-system/3.4.0/js/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/design-system/3.4.0/js/bundle.js"></script>
```

### Option 3: Download assets directly

If you'd like to take a look at the static assets that we publish through npm and our CDN, you can download a tar file for any of the releases [on our GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/releases). You will find these files in the "Assets" section at the bottom of each release.


## Including the CSS

No matter what framework you use to build your application, you will need to include the design system styles in order for your application to look the way it should.

### With HTML

The simplest way to do that is to include a resource link element in your HTML document, like this:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/design-system/5.0.0/css/index.css" />
</head>
```

If you are getting the files from npm, you will want to change the `href` to reference the files from your local `node_modules` folder. Likewise if you've downloaded the files directly, the `href` will point to wherever you've put your files.

### With an asset bundler
For projects that use an asset bundler, include the assets in whatever way your bundler recommends. For instance, in a WebPack or create-react-app project, you might include the styles in your CSS like this:

```css
@import '@cmsgov/design-system/dist/css/index';
```

Or you might import it from your JavaScript like this:

```css
import '@cmsgov/design-system/dist/css/index.css';
```

### Fonts and images

Note that our stylesheets also reference fonts and images, so you will need to make sure these assets (`dist/fonts` and `dist/images`) are available to your site/application at the correct relative paths. You don't need to think about this if you're loading the stylesheet from the CDN, and most asset bundlers will be able to locate these additional assets without additional configuration.

## Using the CSS

The design system styles are broken down into a few categories:

1. Base and typography styles
2. Layout styles
3. Component styles
4. Utility classes

### Base and typography styles

For all the other styles to inherit the correct typography properties, the root of your page content should have a `ds-base` class applied to it. Please see [our base styles documentation](/foundation/base) for more details. Additional [heading](foundation/typography/headings) and [body](foundation/typography/body) typography classes can be found on their respective documentation pages.

### Layout styles

The design system provides a number of layout classes to implement visual structure in your application. Please see [the layout grid documentation](/foundation/layout-grid/layout-grid) to get started. Further resources can be found in the [Layouts](/layouts) section of the doc site.

### Component styles

See the [Using the components]() section below.

### Utility classes

Utility classes help you apply single CSS properties to elements that follow design-system styles. See the [Utilities](/utilities) section of the doc site for more details.

### CSS class naming conventions

All our CSS classes follow a specific naming pattern, outlined below:

<div className="ds-u-measure--wide ds-u-margin-top--2">
  <img src={namingConventionsImg} alt="Diagram explaining the parts of an example CSS class '.ds-c-button--outline' where DS is namespace, C is the type prefix, and the rest follows BEM syntax" class="ds-u-border--1" />
</div>

Note that the design system favors clarity over succinctness. This means the class names may be verbose but should deliver clarity, predictability, and legibility in exchange.

#### Namespace

To avoid conflicting with other libraries and existing code, the design system namespaces its CSS class names with `ds-`.

#### Prefix

Prefixes are added to class names to make it more apparent what job the class is doing.

| Prefix | Description                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `l-`   | Indicates layout-related styles. Example: `.ds-l-container` |
| `c-`   | Indicates a component. Example: `.ds-c-button`              |
| `u-`   | Indicates a utility. Example: `.ds-u-color--base`           |

These prefixes can sometimes be followed by a "breakpoint prefix". [Learn more about breakpoint prefixes.](/foundation/layout-grid/responsive-design/)

#### BEM syntax

Following the namespace and prefix is a name conforming to [BEM syntax](http://getbem.com/introduction/), like `[BLOCK]__[ELEMENT]--[MODIFIER]`, where...

- **BLOCK** is a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. For example: `.ds-c-card`, `.ds-c-button`
- **ELEMENT** is a part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block, such as `.ds-c-card__title`
- **MODIFIER** is a flag on a block or element and is used to change appearance or behavior. For example: `.ds-c-button--primary`, `.ds-u-color--base`, `.ds-l-col--3`
