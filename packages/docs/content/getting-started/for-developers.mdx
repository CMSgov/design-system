Greetings, Developers! This page will walk you through all the basics of using the design system, but another good way to get a jump start is to look through [our example projects on GitHub](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/main/examples/).

As you go through this documentation, keep in mind that the CMS Design System is a [family of design systems](/getting-started/child-design-systems/), and each of these design systems is distributed under a different package name:

- [`design-system`](?theme=core) (Core Design System)
- [`ds-healthcare-gov`](?theme=healthcare) (Healthcare.gov Child Design System)
- [`ds-medicare-gov`](?theme=medicare) (Medicare.gov Child Design System)

## Getting the design system assets

How you get the design system assets depends on the needs of your project and your workstyle. You could...

1. [Install the npm package](#option-1-install-using-npm)
   - Good option if your project already uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management
   - Makes it easy to get patch updates for your major/minor version
2. [Reference files directly from the CDN](#option-2-reference-assets-from-the-cdn)
   - Good option if your project doesn't use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
   - CDN files are versioned, so you always know what version you're using, and those files will be cached by the client's browser
3. [Download the design system assets directly from GitHub](#option-3-download-assets-directly)
   - This is not recommended, but it's available if no other options will work for your project

### Option 1: Install using npm

If you already have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) set up for your project, you can add it to your list of dependencies using one of the commands below. **Note that the following example will display a different package name depending on the theme you have selected.**

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['core']}>

```sh
npm install --save @cmsgov/design-system
# or
yarn add @cmsgov/design-system
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

```sh
npm install --save @cmsgov/ds-healthcare-gov
# or
yarn add @cmsgov/ds-healthcare-gov
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

```sh
npm install --save @cmsgov/ds-medicare-gov
# or
yarn add @cmsgov/ds-medicare-gov
```

</ThemeContent>

Once you've installed the package, read the sections on [how to include the CSS](#including-the-css) and [importing the components into a JavaScript project](#importing-into-a-javascript-project).

### Option 2: Reference assets from the CDN

You can also choose to load the assets directly from our content delivery network (CDN) to your clients' browsers. All packages and their available versions are listed and linked to on our [CDN index page](https://design.cms.gov/cdn/). Each version index page lists all its available resources. CDN resources use the following URL convention:

```
https://design.cms.gov/cdn/<package-name>/<version>/<resource>
```

<Alert heading="What is a CDN and why would I use it?">

A content delivery network (CDN) is a collection of servers that dynamically allocate resources based on the requester's geographic location in order to optimize the distribution of assets. Some benefits and applications for utilizing the design system via CDN are:

- Quickly utilize design system code and style assets for development/prototyping
- The CDN caches assets for fast loading and scales automatically in case of a large number of requests
- Ability to utilize a specific version of the design system easily

<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/ds-medicare-gov/9.0.0/css/medicare-theme.css"
/>
```

#### Example loading web components via CDN

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['core']}>

```html
<script src="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/design-system/7.0.0/web-components/bundle/web-components.js"></script>
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

<script src="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/ds-healthcare-gov/11.0.0/web-components/bundle/web-components.js"></script>
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

```html
<script src="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/ds-medicare-gov/9.0.0/web-components/bundle/web-components.js"></script>
```

</ThemeContent>

### Option 3: Download assets directly

If you'd like to take a look at the static assets that we publish through npm and our CDN, you can download a tar file for any of the releases [on our GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/releases). You will find these files in the "Assets" section at the bottom of each release.

## Including the CSS

No matter what framework you use to build your application, you will need to include the design system styles in order for your application to look the way it should.

### With HTML

You will need to include both the main `index.css` along with a theme file which contains all of the CSS variables needed by the main stylesheet. The simplest way to do that is to include resource link elements in your HTML document, like this:

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['core']}>

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/design-system/7.0.0/css/index.css" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/design-system/7.0.0/css/core-theme.css" />
</head>
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/ds-healthcare-gov/11.0.0/css/index.css" />
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/ds-healthcare-gov/11.0.0/css/healthcare-theme.css"
  />
</head>
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/ds-medicare-gov/9.0.0/css/index.css" />
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://design.cms.gov/cdn/ds-medicare-gov/9.0.0/css/medicare-theme.css"
  />
</head>
```

</ThemeContent>

If you are getting the files from npm, you will want to change the `href` to reference the files from your local `node_modules` folder. Likewise if you've downloaded the files directly, the `href` will point to wherever you've put your files.

### With an asset bundler

For projects that use an asset bundler, include the assets in whatever way your bundler recommends. For instance, in a WebPack or create-react-app project, you might include the styles in your CSS like this:

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['core']}>

```css
@import '@cmsgov/design-system/css/index';
@import '@cmsgov/design-system/css/core-theme';
```

Or you might import it from your JavaScript like this:

```js
import '@cmsgov/design-system/css/index.css';
import '@cmsgov/design-system/css/core-theme.css';
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

```css
@import '@cmsgov/ds-healthcare-gov/css/index';
@import '@cmsgov/ds-healthcare-gov/css/healthcare-theme';
```

Or you might import it from your JavaScript like this:

```js
import '@cmsgov/ds-healthcare-gov/css/index.css';
import '@cmsgov/ds-healthcare-gov/css/healthcare-theme.css';
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

```css
@import '@cmsgov/ds-medicare-gov/css/index';
@import '@cmsgov/ds-medicare-gov/css/medicare-theme';
```

Or you might import it from your JavaScript like this:

```js
import '@cmsgov/ds-medicare-gov/css/index.css';
import '@cmsgov/ds-medicare-gov/css/medicare-theme.css';
```

</ThemeContent>

<Alert heading="Issues with fonts and images" variation="warn">

Note that some bundlers have trouble finding the font and image files when the CSS files are imported through Sass. In those cases, we recommend either adding the `.css` extension to the imports or importing the CSS files directly from JavaScript to avoid limitations of the Sass compiler and/or the WebPack configuration.

</Alert>

### CSS Custom Properties

The CMSDS utilizes [CSS Custom Properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables-1/) to allow for flexible styling of components, layout, animation, typography and color. Lists of variables and their values can be found throughout this documentation.

These custom properties allow for a degree of customization of the design systems components and layout. To modify a CSS variable simply re-define them within a given context. The default context for all CSS Custom properties is as follows:

```css
:root,
::before,
::after,
::backdrop {
  --variable-name: value;
}
```

This allows these classes to apply globally to the entire page they're loaded on. By re-defining these variables in this same scope or defining a variable in a custom scope, such as a specific class, you can overwrite these variables:

```css
.ds-c-button {
  --button__border-color--hover: green;
}
```

### Fonts and images

Note that our stylesheets also reference fonts and images, so you will need to make sure these assets (`dist/fonts` and `dist/images`) are available to your site/application at the correct relative paths. You don't need to think about this if you're loading the stylesheet from the CDN, and most asset bundlers will be able to locate these additional assets without additional configuration.

## Using the CSS

Design system styles can be broken down into the following categories:

1. **[Reset styles](/migration-guides/introducing-a-css-reset/)** - Standardizes the appearance of base elements to overwrite user-agent styles across browsers
2. **Layout styles** - For implementing visual structure in your application
   - Please see [the layout grid documentation](/foundation/layout-grid/layout-grid) to get started
   - Further resources can be found in the [Layouts](/layouts) section of the doc site
3. **Typography styles** - For visually differentiating between kinds of text
   - [Heading](foundation/typography/headings) and [body](foundation/typography/body) typography classes can be found on their respective documentation pages
4. **Component styles** - A collection of designed, self-contained UI elements
   - See the [Using components](#using-components) section below
5. **Utility classes** - For applying single CSS properties to elements using standard values
   - See the [Utilities](/utilities) section of the doc site for more details

### CSS class naming conventions

Most of our CSS classes follow a specific naming pattern, outlined below:

<div className="ds-u-measure--wide ds-u-margin-top--2">
  <img
    src={namingConventionsImg}
    alt="Diagram explaining the parts of an example CSS class '.ds-c-button--outline' where DS is namespace, C is the type prefix, and the rest follows BEM syntax"
    class="ds-u-border--1"
  />
</div>

Note that the design system favors clarity over succinctness. This means the class names may be verbose but should deliver clarity, predictability, and legibility in exchange.

#### Namespace

To avoid conflicting with other libraries and existing code, the design system namespaces its CSS class names with `ds-`.

#### Prefix

Prefixes are added to class names to make it more apparent what job the class is doing.

| Prefix | Description                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `l-`   | Indicates layout-related styles. Example: `.ds-l-container` |
| `c-`   | Indicates a component. Example: `.ds-c-button`              |
| `u-`   | Indicates a utility. Example: `.ds-u-color--base`           |

These prefixes can sometimes be followed by a "breakpoint prefix". [Learn more about breakpoint prefixes.](/foundation/layout-grid/responsive-design/)

#### BEM syntax

Following the namespace and prefix is a name conforming to [BEM syntax](http://getbem.com/introduction/), like `[BLOCK]__[ELEMENT]--[MODIFIER]`, where...

- **BLOCK** is a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. For example: `.ds-c-card`, `.ds-c-button`
- **ELEMENT** is a part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block, such as `.ds-c-card__title`
- **MODIFIER** is a flag on a block or element and is used to change appearance or behavior. For example: `.ds-c-button--primary`, `.ds-u-color--base`, `.ds-l-col--3`

## Using components

Our design system components are more than a collection of styles for making widgets on a page. They embody guidelines, best practices, and interactive behaviors that have been designed for good accessibility and user experience.

While you can apply these styles to your own HTML elements, **we strongly recommend using the JavaScript versions of our components.** The JavaScript components give you those interactive behaviors for free, and without them you'll have to implement the dynamic parts yourself based on the guidance in our documentation. We've made these JavaScript components available as React, Preact, and [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) (though only a subset of our full library is represented by web components at the moment). Please take a look at [our example projects on GitHub](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/main/examples/) for details about each option.

### Using React/Preact components

Inside a React/Preact project, you will import and use the components as you would any other React/Preact component. See the [Importing into a JavaScript project](#importing-into-a-javascript-project) below for more details.

Outside a React/Preact project, your usage will depend on the framework you're using. [Our CDN projects](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/main/examples) show you how to use our React or Preact components in a plain HTML page. Note that for components that don't have interactive behaviors like [Badge](/components/badge), you may not need to invoke React or Preact at all.

More React/Preact prop documentation, examples, and guidance can be found on component documentation pages.

#### Importing into a JavaScript project

If you've installed the design system via npm, the components can be imported from the package entry point using the syntax below. **Note that the following example will display a different package name depending on the theme you have selected.**

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['core']}>

```js
import { Button, TextField } from '@cmsgov/design-system';
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

```js
import { Button, TextField } from '@cmsgov/ds-healthcare-gov';
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

```js
import { Button, TextField } from 'ds-medicare-gov';
```

</ThemeContent>

<Alert heading="Why switch to Preact?">

If you have a React project, chances are you can actually start using [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) today and save on your total bundle size. For our own component library, [we found that switching to Preact shrunk our bundle by about 92KB](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/discussions/2378). The Preact library itself is smaller than React, and so far its claim of full compatability with React has proven true.

Check out [our preact-react-app example](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/main/examples/preact-react-app) if you're curious how to make the switch in an existing React project without changing any of your source code.

</Alert>

If your project is based on Preact and not React, we've provided an import path for you to use the Preact version of our components directly. To import the Preact versions, add `/preact` to the end of your import path like this:

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['core']}>

```js
import { Button, TextField } from '@cmsgov/design-system/preact';
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

```js
import { Button, TextField } from '@cmsgov/ds-healthcare-gov/preact';
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

```js
import { Button, TextField } from 'ds-medicare-gov/preact';
```

</ThemeContent>

### Using web components

We've also begun offering [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) as a framework-agnostic alternative to our React or Preact components. We will be working on expanding this library over time, but at a moment only a subset of our JavaScript components are represented in this library. The easiest way to consume these components is by [loading them from the CDN](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/main/examples/cdn-web-components); however, they can also be installed via npm and imported by appending `/web-components` to your import path.

### Applying component CSS classes manually

If you can't use React, you can apply the appropriate component CSS classes directly to elements in your HTML. Our component documentation pages provide HTML code for the inert states of components, but you'll be responsible for writing the correct markup and updating classes and DOM attributes in response to user events.

The following example shows how you can manually apply `ds-c-label` and `ds-c-field` classes to HTML to achieve more or less the same affect as using the `<TextField>` React component. Note that you would have to update the HTML to show field errors when validating user input or to achieve other dynamic behaviors.

```html
<div>
  <label class="ds-c-label" for="field_1">
    <span>Text Field Label</span>
    <span class="ds-c-hint">Helpful hint text</span>
  </label>
  <input class="ds-c-field" type="text" name="text-field-example" id="field_1" />
</div>
```

## Internationalization

### Providing your own internationalized content

The design system attempts to make all of its components' text content assignable through their React props. That means you can use your own internationalization solutions to provide the content in your applications. Here is an example:

```js
// Example of an application providing its own internationalized content

import { Alert } from '@cmsgov/design-system';
import i18n from 'i18n';

export default function () {
  return <Alert heading={i18n('success')}>{i18n('account.created')}</Alert>;
}
```

### Default internationalized content in the design system

<!-- TODO: Once it is true that all default content is internationalized, we can use this opening paragraph instead
While we want components to be flexible, we also want them to be easy to use, so for some components we do **provide default content**. When we do this, the content comes in English and Spanish.
-->

<!-- TODO: Replace this paragraph with the above paragraph -->

While we want components to be flexible, we also want them to be easy to use, so for some components we do **provide default content**. If a component does not yet have Spanish translations for its default content, that will be noted in the _component maturity_ section of the component documentation page.

For applications that have a `lang` attribute on their html element, **the language will be detected automatically**. If that language is not English or Spanish, the language of the design system will fall back to English. If automatic language detection does not work for your use case, the language can be set manually through the `setLanguage` function. Similarly, the current language can also be read from the `getLanguage` function. Here's an example:

```js
import { getLanguage, setLanguage } from '@cmsgov/design-system';

// Set the design system language to something other than the document's detected language
setLanguage('es');

// Get the design system's current language
console.log(getLanguage());
```

## Analytics

### Turning it on and off

Analytics event tracking is **disabled by default**. There are two ways you can enable or disable analytics in your application:

1. At the application level, globally for all instances of a component with a feature flag
2. At the component-instance level by using the `analytics` prop

The `analytics` prop on a particular component instance will always override whatever the global flag is set to. For instance, you can turn on analytics globally for all alerts using the flag but turn it off for a particular `Alert` on a particular page by setting `analytics={false}` on that `Alert`. It works the other way around too.

As an example, to turn analytics on globally for alerts, put this code somewhere universal to your application:

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['core']}>

```js
import { setAlertSendsAnalytics } from '@cmsgov/design-system';
setAlertSendsAnalytics(true);
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['healthcare']}>

```js
import { setAlertSendsAnalytics } from '@cmsgov/ds-healthcare-gov';
setAlertSendsAnalytics(true);
```

</ThemeContent>

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['medicare']}>

```js
import { setAlertSendsAnalytics } from '@cmsgov/ds-medicare-gov';
setAlertSendsAnalytics(true);
```

</ThemeContent>

Here is the list of each flag-setting function for analytics:

- `setAlertSendsAnalytics`
- `setButtonSendsAnalytics`
- `setDialogSendsAnalytics`
- `setHelpDrawerSendsAnalytics`

### Handling the events

We currently provide two ways of handling analytics events in the design system:

1. Through a global default event handler function, which can be changed
2. Through a function provided to a component instance via the `onAnalyticsEvent` prop

For the global default handler, the design system will currently attempt to pass all events to the `window.utag.link` function if it exists. If this is not the desired analytics behavior for your application, you can provide your own default analytics event handler by calling [`setDefaultAnalyticsFunction`](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/blob/main/packages/design-system/src/components/analytics/events.ts#L111) with your custom implementation, or you can pass a handler to each component instance with the `onAnalyticsEvent` prop.

### Overriding logged data

When you need to prevent sensitive personal information from being passed to analytics trackers from a particular component instance, you can either override the content that contains sensitive information using the `analyticsLabelOverride` prop, or you can disable tracking on that component instance entirely by setting `analytics={false}`.

## Further resources

We hope this page and [our example projects](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/tree/main/examples/) provide you with everything you need to get started with the design system, but if you run into trouble [please reach out](/contact). If you have specific suggestions for how we can improve these docs, please feel free to edit this page (with the link under the table of contents) and submit a pull request!
