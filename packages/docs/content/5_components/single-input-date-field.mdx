Date field (single-input) provides date entry, using a text field, in a single input.

## `<SingleInputDateField>`

<StorybookExample
  componentName="singleInputDateField"
  sourceFilePath="components/DateField/SingleInputDateField.tsx"
  storyId="components-singleinputdatefield--default"
/>

### Props

<PropTable componentName="SingleInputDateField" />

## Guidance

### When to use

- Use the date input when your user flow does not require separate fields for month, day, and year.
- Use the date input for most dates, particularly memorable dates like date of birth, marriage date, health coverage start or end dates, or income start date.

### When to consider alternatives

- Don't use if users are entering a date within the last year or a future date. Instead, use the [date picker](/components/date-picker/).

### Usage

Allow users to have flexibility in entering the date, such as allowing one-digit numbers with or without "0" prior to the number, or entering a date with or without slashes to separate month, day, and year.
  - Example: "1" as well as "01" for a month or day.
  - Example: "05/01/2022" as well as "05012022".

### Accessibility

- These text fields should follow the [accessibility guidelines for all text inputs](/components/text-field/#guidance).
- Users will be able to enter a variety of date formats that automatically format to the correct date format of MM/DD/YYYY. This change happens once the form field loses focus. For example, a user enters a date as "4122020" and it changes to "04/01/2020" once focus leaves the date input.

## Customization

The following Sass variables can be overridden to customize Input/Form components:

<ComponentThemeOptions
  componentname="text-input"
/>

### Form components

<ComponentThemeOptions
  componentname="form"
/>
