title: Modal dialog
---

import { Dialog } from '@cmsgov/design-system';

The dialog component can be used to focus a user's attention on a single piece of content, without taking them to a new screen. Please use with caution; view our guidance for more details.

## Dialog size variants

Apply one of the size modifier classes to the `ds-c-dialog` element to change the dialog width.

- `.ds-c-dialog--narrow`
- `.ds-c-dialog--wide`
- `.ds-c-dialog--full`

## `<Dialog />`

<StorybookExample
  componentName="dialog"
  sourceFilePath="components/Dialog/Dialog.tsx"
  storyId="components-dialog--dialog-example"
  minHeight={400}
/>

### Props

<PropTable componentName="Dialog" />

## Guidance

### Usage

- `<Dialog>` makes use of the `<AriaModal>` component maintained by [react-aria-modal docs on Github](https://github.com/davidtheclark/react-aria-modal). The above documented props are only those directly exposed by the `<Dialog>` component, but you can pass props specific to `<AriaModal>` here as well, e.g. you can set the [`scrollDisabled`](https://github.com/davidtheclark/react-aria-modal#scrolldisabled) prop if you'd like to enable scrolling behind the modal window.

### Accessibility

#### Keyboard support

- `Enter` or `Space` to select the highlighted item.
- `Tab` to move the focus sequentially through the list of focusable items.
- `Shift + Tab` to move the focus sequentially through the list of focusable items in reversed order.

#### Focus Management

- When the modal is opened, the entire modal is the default focus state. Most screen readers will announce the entire dialog content.
- Focus is trapped within the modal and users can then navigate through the dialog actions with the keyboard.
- Escape will close the modal. To disable exiting when users press the Escape key, set the `escapeExits` prop to `false`
- When the modal closes, focus returns to the element that was focused just before the modal is activated
- To place the focus inside of the dialog on activating the modal, set the dialog focus using the `initialFocus` prop with boolean prop `focusDialog` set to `false`

## Google Analytics

**Analytics event tracking is disabled by default.**

### Enable event tracking

Import and set the `setDialogSendsAnalytics` feature flag to `true` in your application's entry file:

```js
import { setDialogSendsAnalytics } from '@cmsgov/<design-system-package>';
setDialogSendsAnalytics(true);
```

On applications where the page has `utag` loaded, the data goes to Tealium which allows it to route to Google Analytics or the currently approved data analytics tools.

### Disable event tracking

For the `analytics` prop, pass the value `false` to the component to disable analytics tracking for a singular component instance

```js
analytics={false}
```

### Override event tracking

A custom heading value can be sent for an analytics event by using the prop `analyticsLabelOverride`. It is recommended that this value be used to prevent sensitive personal information from being passed to analytics trackers.
