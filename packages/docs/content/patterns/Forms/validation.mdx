title: Form validation
---

## Guidance

- Use [inline errors](/components/inline-error) to give validation feedback for specific form fields. See that page for specific guidance around inline errors.
- If the page is fully refreshed, add ‘Error: ’ to the beginning of the page `<title>` so screen readers read it out as soon as possible.

### Validation types

#### Error

- Visually associate inline validation messages with the input fields (e.g., place validation closely to the input field).
- Place an icon in front of an error to draw attention to an error.
- Use color as a secondary way to draw attention to an error.

#### Success

- Form field success validation is only use for password creation. 
    - Use success validation to show when a user has met the password criteria
- Other forms of success validation can be used with check mark icons, alert messages, progress bars/step list page, and toast messages.

### Content

- Use sentence case
- End with a period
- Use the fewest words possible (i.e., don't use "please")

#### Error

- Describe what the user still needs to do in a mandatory field that has been left incomplete or unanswered,  or answered incorrectly
- Repeat what the form label is asking the user to do, but with slightly more detail

##### Success

- Form field success validation is only used for password creation
- Describe when a user has met the criteria
