## Guidance

### 5-digit ZIP format

Use the `small` input field when data validation uses a 5-digit ZIP format.

<EmbeddedExample>
  <TextField size="small" label="Please enter your 5-digit ZIP code" hint="This field is 'small' size" name="zip-small" numeric />
</EmbeddedExample>

### 9-digit ZIP format

Use the `medium` input field when validating against a stricter data set, such as the 9-digit format.

<EmbeddedExample>
  <TextField size="medium" label="Please enter your 9-digit ZIP code" hint="This field is 'medium' size" name="zip-medium" numeric />
</EmbeddedExample>

### County selection

Use the default (`large`) input field when the user must confirm or enter data containing County, State, and ZIP code.

<EmbeddedExample>
  <TextField label="Enter your ZIP code to start searching and then select your county from the list" name="zip-default" numeric />
</EmbeddedExample>

## Interactions

- To reduce cognitive load, use the 5-digit pattern which supports a mental model that widely exists.
- Specific validation of numeric values 0â€“9, spaces, and dashes.
- Let the user pick the ZIP code and county/state option from an autocomplete option. In some use cases the ZIP code alone is ambiguous because some ZIP codes are in more than one county.
- Display the option the user selects from the autocomplete option list
- Error prevention clearly indicate the user needs to enter a valid ZIP code before moving to the next item.

## User pain points

- A small-sized input field works for a 5-digit ZIP code but hides a 9-digit format.
- A medium-sized input field accommodates a 9-digit ZIP format but hides additional data such as county and/or state.
- Some users' browsers auto-populate the 9-digit  ZIP code, including the dash. This interaction can be problematic when using the small input field.
- ZIP codes are not always consistent. They may not reflect the current geography, which can lead to problems when services rely on the accuracy of the ZIP code.
