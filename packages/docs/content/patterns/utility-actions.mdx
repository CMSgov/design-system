title: Utility Actions
intro: Utility actions for a webpage including print, email, RSS and more.
---

import { TextField } from '@cmsgov/design-system';

## Guidance

### When to use

- If you would like to give the user the option to print or email a page.
- If you would like to give the user the option to enable RSS.
- These "utility actions" are considered [ghost buttons](/components/button/#ghost-button) for actions available that do not take priority over a primary or secondary CTAs (e.g., print, email, RSS).

### When to consider alternatives

- If an action (e.g. printing or emailing) is a critical call-to-action on a webpage, consider using a solid or outlined main button.
- If the utility action is opening a link versus triggering an action, please reference [guidance on links](/foundation/typography/links).
- Consider carefully which Utility Actions are used on mobile since space is a premium.

### Usage

- This pattern uses a [ghost button](/components/button/#ghost-button) component with a left icon boolean.
- Placement should be in page header.
- Top, right aligned.
- For typeface please reference [guidance on links](/foundation/typography/links).
- When pairing two or more buttons the preferred/main action is placed on the left.
  - Order of actions should be consistent across pages and products.

### Accessibility

- Icons without the text label are an accessibility concern.
- Every Utility Action should be unique on a page. A single page with multiple "print" actions can cause confusion for screen readers.
