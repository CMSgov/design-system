Hey everyone, we're doing something new! We've saved up a program increment's worth of updates into a single release, and it's going out with a little fanfare. Watch or listen to our introduction video below—complete with closed captions—and check out our other demo videos sprinkled throughout this article. Enjoy!

### What's new in 6.0

#### Component maturity checklist

We established a checklist that measures each component's path toward maturity and stability through [well-defined and repeatable processes](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/blob/main/COMPONENT_MATURITY.md). This _maturity model_ evaluates a component's accessibility, code, Sketch assets, and use of design tokens as a series of checklist items that have a complete, incomplete, or not-applicable status. This checklist helps us track progress on components and also helps application teams make informed decisions about when to use certain components, when to wait, or when to contribute.
