## Working with these fonts

The design system provides guidance for [headings](/foundation/typography/headings/), [body copy](/foundation/typography/body/), [links](/foundation/typography/links/), and [lists](/foundation/typography/lists/).

### The `ds-content` class

For pages that are mainly about written content or places where you want to use a standard mapping of heading-level styles to semantic heading levels, consider using the [`ds-content` class](/foundation/typography/content/).

### Responsive typography

To apply responsive typography elsewhere, use the [font size utility class](/utilities/font/font-size/#responsive-font-sizes). Since the base typography margins and line height is measured in em units, they'll automatically adjust as you change the font size.

### Accessibility

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['core']}>

Sans-serifs have been proven to be easier to read on-screen and are incredibly adaptable when resized and displayed across different platforms and browsers. Accordingly, Open Sans is used for body type, secondary and tertiary headlines, and instructional text.

- Standard body text is Open Sans Regular, 16px, #333, 24px line-height, 32px bottom-margin on paragraphs.

- Smallest paragraph text for legibility reasons is Open Sans Regular, 14px, #333, 20px line-height, 28px bottom-margin on paragraphs (except for legal/caption text).

- Uppercase font should not be used.
