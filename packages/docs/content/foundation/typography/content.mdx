For pages that are mainly about written content or places where you want to use a standard mapping of heading-level styles to semantic heading levels, we have a special `ds-content` CSS class. Applying this class to an element that surrounds your content will automatically apply design system heading styles to the appropriate `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, and `h6` tags as well as `ol` and `ul` list tags.

## Example

<StorybookExample
  componentName="content-class"
  storyId="foundations-typography-headings--content-class"
/>
