order: 40
intro: System color tokens are the entire set of color tokens from which our themes are built.

While this page shows the full range of colors, it's essential to use the theme color tokens identified for your brand's experience when building your product. Think of system color tokens like an entire box of crayons; our themes use specific colors from the box, not all of them.
