intro: The design system provides a flexible color palette that meets accessible color contrast requirements.

Color is a key element in our design system used to create meaning and consistency. Our color palette helps to unify our brandâ€™s experiences, from product interfaces to marketing.

You can apply color to:

- Convey emotion
- Express a tone
- Guide attention
- Pinpoint critical items

Below you will find a set of well-defined guidelines on how to work with our colors.

## Brand colors

### Primary colors

Our primary color palette is designed for use throughout our digital products within interfaces and for branding. Primary colors are displayed most frequently across our products' screens and components.

Primary colors are used for:

- Key actions such as primary call to action buttons
- Highlighted content
- Form field elements

We chose colors that offer a range of uses and that meet or exceed standards in supporting accessibility and contrast for low vision users.

The guidelines indicate how colors should be applied, noting where some should be utilized sparingly and with purpose for specific components like errors or messaging.

### Secondary colors

<ThemeContent onlyThemes={['core', 'medicare']}>

These are accent colors to provide additional lightness and style to pages looking for a more modern flair. These colors should be used to highlight important features on a page, such as buttons, or for visual style elements, such as illustrations. They should be used sparingly and never draw the eye to more than one piece of information at a time.
