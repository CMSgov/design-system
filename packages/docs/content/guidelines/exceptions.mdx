<b>Deviations from the standards outlined need special approval</b> (in addition to product team approvals.) This ensures consistency and a cohesive user experience across all of Medicare.gov.

The approval process requires sign-off by the following CMS internal teams:

- Design Guild (Melissa Liupaeter, Allyssa Allen)
- UX Guild (includes production, UX, and content leads from eMedicare products)
- Leadership special approval (Erin Pressley and OC Front Office)

## Exceptions Process

<b>This process occurs prior to finalizing mock-ups through eMedicare product teams. Exceptions should never be implemented without expressed approval.</b> Generally takes about 2 weeks to complete approval process.

1. Product team member (designer, UX, content, product lead, etc.) identifies the item and raises the exception request to the CMS Design Guild.
2. CMS Design Guild triages the request. (If it doesn't warrant raising, provides the answer.)
3. CMS Design & UX Guilds research, check feasibility, make final recommendation, and send to Erin Pressley.
4. Erin makes decision (and raises to OC Front Office, if needed).
5. CMS UX Guild provides answer and updates guidance.
