The CMS Design System strives to work for as many people as possible, including people with disabilities.

## What we do to help meet and exceed standards

- Embed [accessibility and inclusive design practices](https://accessibility.digital.gov/) into our workflow.
- Provide accessibility as a [checkpoint in new components](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/component-validation-checklist.md) created in the design system.
- Add accessibility as a key aspect to much of the [component documentation](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/blob/main/guides/WRITING-DOCUMENTATION.md).
- Conduct regular accessibility reviews of new and existing features and documentation for the design system.
- Utilize [axe-webdriverjs](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-webdriverjs) for automated accessibility testing in our end to end testing.

### What we use for accessibility testing

| Operating system | Browser | Screen reader |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| OS X 13.2.1 (Ventura)      | Safari (latest version)       | VoiceOver |
| Windows 10   | Chrome (latest version)        | NVDA (latest version) |
| Windows 10   | Edge (latest version)        | JAWS 2021 |

## What level we meet currently

The CMS Design System currently meets or exceeds [WCAG 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) standards, which requires information and communications technology developed, procured, maintained, or used by the federal government be accessible to both employees and members of the public with disabilities.

More information on Section 508 can be found at:

- [United States Access Board](http://www.access-board.gov/508.htm)
- [Section508.gov](http://www.section508.gov)
- [HHS Digital Communications Division](http://www.hhs.gov/web/508)

- Windows 10 with Internet Explorer 11 and JAWS 2019.
- Windows 10 with Firefox (latest) and NVDA (latest).
