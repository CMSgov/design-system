Dropdowns allow users to select one option from a temporary modal menu.

## `<Dropdown>`

A `Dropdown` component can be used to render an HTML `select` menu. Any _undocumented_ props that you pass to this component will be passed to the `select` element, so you can use this to set additional attributes if necessary.

Class-based component gives flexibility for active focus management by allowing refs to be passed.

<StorybookExample
  componentName="dropdown"
  sourceFilePath="components/Dropdown/Dropdown.tsx"
  storyId="components-dropdown--default-dropdown"
  minHeight={250}
/>

### Props

<PropTable componentName="Dropdown" />

## Guidance

### When to use

- **Use sparingly**. Use the dropdown component only when a user needs to choose from about seven to 15 possible options and you have limited space to display the options.

### When to consider alternatives

- **Fewer than seven options.** Use [radio buttons or checkboxes](/components/checkbox-and-radio/) instead.
- **More than 15 options.** If the list of options is very long. Let users type the same information into a text input that suggests possible options instead.
- **Multi-select.** If you need to allow users to select more than one option at once. Users often don’t understand how to select multiple items from dropdowns. Use [checkboxes]({{root}}/components/choice) instead.
- **Site navigation.** Use the [navigation components](/components/vertical-nav/) instead.

### Usage

- **Make sure to test.** Test dropdowns thoroughly with members of your target audience. Several usability experts suggest they should be the “UI of last resort.” Many users find them confusing and difficult to use.
- **Avoid dependent options.** Avoid making options in one dropdown menu change based on the input to another. Users often don’t understand how selecting an item in one impacts another.
- **Use a good default.** When most users will (or should) pick a particular option, make it the selected default. **If a good default is not an option**, use a descriptive placeholder like `- Select a state -` as the selected default.
- **Avoid auto-submission.** Don’t use JavaScript to automatically submit the form (or do anything else) when an option is selected. Auto-submission disrupts screen readers because they select each option as they read them.

### Accessibility

- **Customize accessibly.** If you customize the dropdown, ensure it continues to meet the the [accessibility requirements that apply to all form controls](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/form-controls/).
- **Always use a label.** Make sure your dropdown has a label. Don’t replace it with the default menu option (for example, removing the “State” label and just having the dropdown read “Select a state” by default).
- **Avoid auto-submission.** Don’t use JavaScript to automatically submit the form (or do anything else) when an option is selected. Auto-submission disrupts screen readers because they select each option as they read them.

## Customization

The following Sass variables can be overridden to customize Dropdown components:

<ComponentThemeOptions
  theme="core"
  componentname="dropdown"
/>

## Text Input Options

<ComponentThemeOptions
  theme="core"
  componentname="text-input"
/>
