Use the following utilities to apply focus styles to custom UI components.

## Examples

### Focus rings

**Focus**

Use the `.focus:ring` utility to conditionally apply focus styles to your component when that component has focus. Focus will be applied regardless of keyboard or mouse interaction.

Click or tab into the following example to see this utility in action.

<EmbeddedExample>
  <p tabIndex="0" class="focus:ring ds-u-border--1 ds-u-padding--2">Focus state example</p>
</EmbeddedExample>

**Focus-visible**

Use the `.focus-visible:ring` utility to conditionally apply focus styles to your component when that component has keyboard focus.

Tab into the following example to see this utility in action.

<EmbeddedExample>
  <p tabIndex="0" class="focus-visible:ring ds-u-border--1 ds-u-padding--2">Focus-visible state example</p>
</EmbeddedExample>

**Focus-within**

Use the `.focus-within:ring` utility to conditionally apply focus styles to your component when a child element of that component has focus. Focus will be applied regardless of keyboard or mouse interaction.

Click or tab into the following example to see this utility in action.

<EmbeddedExample>
  <div class="focus-within:ring ds-u-border--1 ds-u-padding--2">
    <p>Focus-within example</p>
    <Button className="ds-u-margin-right--1">Foo</Button>
    <Button className="ds-u-margin-right--1">Bar</Button>
    <Button>Baz</Button>
  </div>
</EmbeddedExample>

### Using the `ring` utility

Use the `ring` utility to create outline rings with box-shadows. 

This utility can be added or removed using JavaScript to act as a reusable focus indicator if other focus options don't work for your specific use-case.

<EmbeddedExample>
  <div tabIndex="0" class="ring">Always focus example</div>
</EmbeddedExample>
