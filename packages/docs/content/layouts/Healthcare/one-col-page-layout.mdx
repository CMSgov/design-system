A one column page, as basic as it comes.

<ThemeContent neverThemes={['healthcare']}>
  <Alert variation="error">
     <p class="ds-c-alert__text">
        This component is only used for Healthcare. Please use the theme switcher to view the component with Healthcare styles.
    </p>
  </Alert>
</ThemeContent>

/>

## Guidance

### When to use

- A one column layout is useful for presenting a page that includes a form.
- A one column layout is a great approach for a text-heavy page.


### When to consider alternatives

- Use a landing page when introducing users to your application, agency, or organization.

### Usage

Prioritize your content by organizing content into three regions.

- **Page header**
  - Page headers contain the following items: Backlinks, breadcrumb, progress bars, or utility links (print, email, RSS), Lead text, subtitles, sub-headers, or page-level alerts.
- **Page content**
  - Primary content.
- **Page footer**
  - Pain index or utility links (print, email, RSS).

### Used in this pattern
