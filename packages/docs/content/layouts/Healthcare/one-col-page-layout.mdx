## Guidance

### When to use

- A single column layout is useful for presenting a page which includes a form.
- A single column layout is a great approach for a text-heavy page.


### When to consider alternatives

- Use a landing page when introducing users to your application, agency or organization.

### Usage

Prioritize your content by organizing content into three regions in order of importance.

Page content hierarchy:
- Backlinks, breadcrumb, progress bars, or utility links (print, email, rss).
- Lead text, a subtitle or a sub-header, page-level alerts, primary content.
- Outro text or help links.
