<ThemeContent neverThemes={['healthcare']}>
  <Alert variation="error">

      This component is only used for Healthcare. Please use the theme switcher to view the
      component with Healthcare styles.

  </Alert>
</ThemeContent>

## Guidance

### When to use

- A one column layout is useful for presenting a page that includes a form.
- A one column layout is a great approach for a text-heavy page.

### When to consider alternatives

- Use a landing page when introducing users to your application, agency, or organization.

### Usage

Prioritize your content by organizing content into three regions.

- Page headers contain the following items:
  - Backlinks
  - Breadcrumbs
  - Progress bars
  - Lead text
  - Subtitles
  - Sub-headers
  - Page-level alerts
  - Utility links (print, email, RSS)
- Page content contains primary content.
- Page footer contains page or utility links (e.g., print, email, RSS).

### Used in this pattern

- [Healthcare.gov Header](/components/header/healthcare-header/)
- [Grid](/foundation/layout-grid/layout-grid/)
- [Base typography](/foundation/typography/body/)
- [Healthcare.gov Footer](/components/footer/healthcare-footer/)
