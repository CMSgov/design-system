title: Accessibility
---

CMS strives to make its Design System work for as many people as possible, including people with disabilities.

## What we do to help meet and exceed standards

- build accessibility into our [guiding principles](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/blob/master/guides/GUIDING-PRINCIPLES.md).
- include accessibility as part of our design process when working on new or existing components.
- provide accessibility as a [checkpoint in new components](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/component-validation-checklist.md) created in the design system.
- add accessibility as a key aspect to much of the [component documentation](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/blob/master/guides/WRITING-DOCUMENTATION.md).
- conduct regular accessibility reviews of new and existing features and documentation for the design system.

## What level we meet currently

The CMS Design System currently meets or exceeds Section 508 standards, which requires that information and computer technology (ICT) be accessible to people with disabilities. Section 508 requires that ICT developed, procured, maintained, or used by the federal government be accessible to both employees and members of the public with disabilities.

More information on Section 508 can be found at:

- [United States Access Board](http://www.access-board.gov/508.htm)
- [Section508.gov](http://www.section508.gov)
- [HHS Digital Communications Division](http://www.hhs.gov/web/508)

## Current browser/technology support

The current browser support for the design system [can be viewed here](https://design.cms.gov/startup/browser-support/). We test with the following assistive technology pairings:

- Windows 10 with Internet Explorer 11 and JAWS 2019.
- Windows 10 with Firefox (latest) and NVDA (latest).
- MacOS Mojave with Safari (latest) and VoiceOver (latest).
