## Usage

Use the breakpoint prefixes `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl` to apply styles at different viewport sizes.

| Prefix | Breakpoint | Description |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| | `min-width(0px)` | Viewports 0px and wider |
| `sm` | `min-width(544px)` | Viewports 544px and wider |
| `md` | `min-width(768px)` | Viewports 768px and wider |
| `lg` | `min-width(1024px)` | Viewports 1024px and wider |
| `xl` | `min-width(1280px)` | Viewports 1280px and wider |

For example: `ds-u-lg-display--none` sets an element's `display` property to `none` when the viewport is `1024px` or wider.
