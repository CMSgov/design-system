The design system's layout, utility, and typography classes are built with responsive web design in mind and is built to be **mobile first**.

## Breakpoints

Use the breakpoint prefixes `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl` to apply styles at different viewport sizes. For example: `ds-u-lg-display--none` sets an element's `display` property to `none` when the viewport is `1024px` or wider.

| Prefix | Breakpoint          | Sass variable | Description                  |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
|        | `min-width(0px)`    | `$width-xs`   | Viewports `0px` and wider    |
| `sm`   | `min-width(544px)`  | `$width-sm`   | Viewports `544px` and wider  |
| `md`   | `min-width(768px)`  | `$width-md`   | Viewports `768px` and wider  |
| `lg`   | `min-width(1024px)` | `$width-lg`   | Viewports `1024px` and wider |
| `xl`   | `min-width(1280px)` | `$width-xl`   | Viewports `1280px` and wider |
