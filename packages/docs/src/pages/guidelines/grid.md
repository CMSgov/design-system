title: Grid layout
---

Choosing a suitable grid solution is dependent on several factors. Some of these factors are browser support, if and which CSS preprocessor is being used, degree of customizability, and [layout mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_mode) preference.

As a result, the design system doesn't currently include its own grid framework and instead suggests that you create your own simple grid solution, or pick from existing solutions, based on what works best for your project and preferences.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of existing grid solutions:

- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/)
- [Flexbox Grid](http://flexboxgrid.com/)
- [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/)
- [Unsemantic](https://unsemantic.com/)
- [Bootstrap grid](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid)
