<h4 class="ds-h4 ds-u-font-size--base">Minified CSS</h4>

The easiest way to add the design system's styles to your site is by referencing its minified CSS.

1. Download the zip file from the latest CMS design system release and open that file.
1. Copy the `packages/core/dist/index.css` file into a relevant place in your code base â€” likely a directory where you keep third-party libraries. In the example below, our directory is `css/vendor`.
1. Add a `<link>` to the stylesheet in your site's `<head>`

For example:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" src="/css/vendor/design-system-core/index.css" />
```

<h4 class="ds-h4 ds-u-font-size--base" id="sass">Sass</h4>

If you're already using Sass to style your site, another way to include the design system's styles is by importing its un-minified Sass file from NPM.

1. First, make sure your build system is configured so that the `node_modules` directory is in the list of Sass [`includePaths`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#includepaths).
2. Add the following to your Sass file:

```css
@import '@cmsgov/design-system-core/src/index';
```

<h4 class="ds-h4 ds-u-font-size--base">Applying styles to your page</h4>

Once your page is loading the design system's CSS, you can then begin applying its styling to your pages. Below is an example of a project applying the [base-level of styles]({{root}}/style/base) and a [utility class]({{root}}/utilities/).

```html
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" src="/css/vendor/design-system-core/index.css" />
</head>
<body class="ds-base">
  <h1 class="ds-u-font-size--title">Hello world</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
