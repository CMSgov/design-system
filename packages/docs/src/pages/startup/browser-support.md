The CMS design system is designed to support older and newer browsers through [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement). The current major version of the design system (2.0) follows the [2% rule](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/01/25/support-for-browsers/): we officially support any browser above 2% usage as observed by [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/). Currently, this means that the newest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer 11 and up are supported.
