The design system is a set of open source design and front-end development resources for creating Section 508 compliant, responsive, and consistent websites. It includes [CSS and React components]({{root}}/components), [utility classes]({{root}}/utilities), a [grid framework]({{root}}/layout/grid), design and development best practices, and other resources to help you quickly prototype and build production-ready websites.

It is currently being applied to [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/). It is open source and freely available to use by anyone.

## Goals

The primary goals for the design system are to:

- Help create consistent, enjoyable, reliable, and Section 508 compliant government websites.
- Promote best practices for usability, accessibility, and responsive web design.
- Empower teams and speed up design and development velocity.
- Serve as a living source of truth for UI standards.

In order to meet these goals we are:

- Using the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov) components and visual design as a foundation. Read more about how we're applying the Standards in our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/wiki/faq).
- Reducing the overall footprint of websites by writing [scalable CSS]({{root}}/guidelines/code-conventions).
- Supporting rapid development with [utility classes]({{root}}/utilities) and easy-to-use [components]({{root}}/components) with best practices baked in.
- Reducing the number of decisions needed when iterating on UI by providing a solid foundation of [typography]({{root}}/style/typography), [layout]({{root}}/layout/grid), and [color]({{root}}/style/color).
- Distributing resources as [NPM packages]({{root}}/getting-started) which can be easily installed, updated, and imported.
