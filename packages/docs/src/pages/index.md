<p class="ds-text--lead">The design system is a set of design and front-end development resources for creating Section 508 compliant, responsive, and consistent websites. It includes design and development guidelines, [UI components]({{root}}/components), [utility classes]({{root}}/utilities), and other resources which you can use for quickly prototyping and building production-ready websites.</p>

It is currently being applied to [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/), and we'd love to hear from you if you decide to use it on your project.

## Extending U.S. Web Design Standards

The design system is a variation and extension of the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov). If you're familiar with the Standards, then the visual style of the design system should look familiar. This is deliberate and part of our goal to promote consistency and accessibility across federal government websites, a goal we share with the Standards.

The design system differs from the U.S. Web Design Standards in the following ways:

- **[Code conventions]({{root}}/guidelines/code-conventions)** - The design system follows a different naming convention in order to avoid conflicts with existing CSS and to deliver clarity and resilience.
- **[Utilities]({{root}}/utilities)** - The design system includes granular utility classes for forming a variety of UI patterns.
- **[Flexbox grid]({{root}}/layout/grid)** - The design system's responsive grid framework uses the flexbox layout mode, enabling functionality that would be non-trivial using floats.
- **[Responsive classes]({{root}}/guidelines/responsive/)** - The design system provides the ability to quickly and easily adjust the layout and typography based on viewport size.
- **React support** - The design system includes React components for the majority of UI components.

Shoutout to 18F and GSA for the hard work they put into the Standards. We're excited to contribute back any learnings and progress.
