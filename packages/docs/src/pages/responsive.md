The design system's utility and typography classes are built with reponsive web design in mind and is built to be **mobile first**. Use the prefixes `sm`, `md`, and `lg` to quickly and easily adjust your layout and content for different screen sizes and devices. Further info and usage examples are available on the individual documentation pages.

| Prefix | Breakpoint | Description |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| `sm` | `min-width(544px)` | Viewports 544px and wider |
| `md` | `min-width(768px)` | Viewports 768px and wider |
| `lg` | `min-width(1024px)` | Viewports 1024px and wider |
| `xl` | `min-width(1280px)` | Viewports 1280px and wider |

For example: `ds-u-lg-display--none` sets an element's `display` property to `none` when the viewport is `1024px` or wider.
