## Project Structure

Some directories are specific to Gatsby and details can be found on [this Gatsby documentation page](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-project-structure/).

These directories include

- `src/pages`: files in this directory automatically become pages with paths based on file names
- `src/templates`: templates for programmatically creating pages
- `static`: files in this folder will be copied to the `public` folder untouched

Additional directories that are not Gatsby specific include:

- `src/components`: these are component only used for the documentation site
- `src/styles`: documentation site-specific styles
- `content`: Contains markdown for site page content
