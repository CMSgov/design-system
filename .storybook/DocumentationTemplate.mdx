## Props

{/*
  * Note that ArgsTable is technically deprecated in v7, but Storybook has yet
  * to offer a solid alternative for stories with subcomponents. This args
  * table will render multiple tabs when there is a `subcomponents` property
  * present in the story meta. See the following discussions:
  * 
  *   - https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/21253
  *   - https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/20782
  * 
  * If they remove this feature, the path forward may be to create our own
  * custom "doc block" that uses the
  * [useOf](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/doc-block-useof) hook.
