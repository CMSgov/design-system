### Using the Sketch Library

- [Using library symbols](https://www.sketch.com/docs/libraries/#library-symbols)
- [Using library styles](https://www.sketch.com/docs/libraries/#library-styles)
- [Updating library components](https://www.sketch.com/docs/libraries/#updating-library-components)

When you use the file as a Sketch Library, anytime you or anyone else makes updates to symbols, text styles, or layer styles in the Sketch Library, any of your Sketch files that use those library components will be able to automatically update to match those changes. You'll get an update notification in your Sketch file, and can review those changes and confirm them to make sure youâ€™re always using the most up-to-date components in your work.
