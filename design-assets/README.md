The `design-assets` folder contains:

- CMS Design System (CMSDS) Sketch file
- CMSDS fonts (Bitter, Open Sans, and Font Awesome)

## Usage

The CMSDS design assets are avaliable in two formats, as a Sketch Library, and as a Sketch file.

**We highly recommend using the CMSDS Sketch Library**, as it automatically receives updates when new versions of the Sketch Library are released. [Learn more about Sketch Libraries and how to use them](https://www.sketch.com/docs/libraries/).

### Installing the Sketch library

- Visit the [CMS Design System homepage](design.cms.gov) and click the `Get the Sketch Library` link under "Getting started".

- Paste the following url in your browser to open and download the library in Sketch

```
sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCMSgov%2Fdesign-system%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fdesign-assets%2Fcms-design-system-ui-kit.xml
```

### Using the Sketch Library

- [Using library symbols](https://www.sketch.com/docs/libraries/#library-symbols)
- [Using library styles](https://www.sketch.com/docs/libraries/#library-styles)
- [Updating library components](https://www.sketch.com/docs/libraries/#updating-library-components)

When you use the file as a Sketch Library, anytime you or anyone else makes updates to symbols, text styles, or layer styles in the Sketch Library, any of your Sketch files that use those library components will be able to automatically update to match those changes. You'll get an update notification in your Sketch file, and can review those changes and confirm them to make sure youâ€™re always using the most up-to-date components in your work.
