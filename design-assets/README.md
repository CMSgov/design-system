### Using the CMSDS Sketch Library

We encourge usage of the CMSDS Sketch Library. When you update components in a Library, documents that use them will get an update notification. You can review those changes and confirm them to make sure youâ€™re always using the most up-to-date components in your work.

- Visit the design.cms.gov homepage and click the `get the Sketch Library` link.
  OR
- paste this url into your browser `sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCMSgov%2Fdesign-system%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fdesign-assets%2Fcms-design-system-ui-kit.xml`

Sketch will then open and download the CMSDS Sketch Library.
