Hi everyone.

00:01.000 --> 00:05.000
My name is Krithi and I'm a product manager working on the CMS Design system team.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Thanks for taking the time to check out our first release video.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
We hope to do many more of these in the future and that they're helpful for understanding what's new with the design systems.

00:15.000 --> 00:28.000
If you're not already aware, the CMS WDS Experienced Team brings you updates to the CMS core design system along with updates to its Healthcare.gov and Medicare.gov child design systems.

00:28.000 --> 00:36.000
In PI-4, we decided to test out a new release cycle to better help product teams anticipate design system changes.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Building a family of design systems comes with plenty of technical challenges.

00:40.000 --> 00:52.000
All year we've been releasing code updates on a bi weekly basis, but data showed that these updates were hard to keep track of and product teams were unable to ingest changes without planning in advance.

00:52.000 --> 01:03.000
So this program increment, we decided to slow down our release cycle in order to focus more on being intentional about our communication, documentation, and quality assurance.

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
Product teams can now expect major and minor releases from the CMS Design System to occur at the end of every program increment.

01:12.000 --> 01:20.000
In addition, each major release will be accompanied with release notes, a video, a blog post, and slack communications.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
We hope that this shift will allow product teams to better anticipate and plan for design-system updates.

01:26.000 --> 01:37.000
During program increment planning, we've made a lot of improvements to the design systems over the last 10 weeks, and we're excited to walk you through some of those updates in this post.

01:37.000 --> 01:53.000
If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to us in Slack at the #cms-design-system channel, or you can visit the contact us page on design.cms.gov to find all the ways you can get in touch with us.

01:53.000 --> 02:02.000
So thank you so much for reading this post, and keep scrolling to see a preview of what's in store for version five of the CMSDS.
