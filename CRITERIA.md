# Design System criteria

The contents of the Design System are high quality and meet user needs. To guarantee this, all components and patterns must meet certain criteria.

## New proposals

To be successful, proposals need to show that the component or pattern being suggested would be useful and unique.

### Useful
There is evidence that this component or pattern would be useful in many different situations and contexts.
Evidence could be screenshots or links to versions of it being used in different services.

### Unique
It doesn’t duplicate something which already exists in the Design System, unless it’s intended to replace it.

Proposals in the [backlog](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/projects/3)  are reviewed to check if they meet these criteria. Proposals that meet the criteria will then be moved into the 'To do' column, ready to be worked on.


## Before a component or pattern is published

Implementation of the component or pattern are reviewed to make sure it is usable, consistent and versatile.

### Usable

It has been tried in user research and shown to work with a representative sample of users, including those with disabilities. Components and patterns which are not proven usable can be published as experimental. But they must be clearly based on relevant user research from other organizations and best practice, and meet the other criteria.

### Consistent

It follows style and code guidelines and components in the Design System where possible. Both the guidance and any content included in examples must follow the [GOV.UK content style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style). Any code follows the [GOV.UK Frontend coding standards](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/tree/master/docs/contributing/coding-standards) and is ready to merge into GOV.UK Frontend.

### Versatile

The implementation is versatile enough that component or pattern can be used in a range of different services that may need it. For example, a versatile date input component could be set up to ask for a year only, a month and year only, a precise date, or any other combination you may need. The component or pattern must also have been tested and shown to work with a range of browsers, assistive technologies and devices.
